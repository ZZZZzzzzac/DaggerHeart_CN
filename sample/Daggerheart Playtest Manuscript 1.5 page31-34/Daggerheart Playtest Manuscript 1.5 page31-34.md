# Reading Domain Cards

During step 8 of character creation and as your character levels up, you'll gain increasingly powerful domain cards, which provide abilities and spells you can utilize during your adventures.

Some domain cards provide moves you can make (see "On your Turn" in chapter 2), like a unique attack or a spell you cast. Others offer passive benefits (which always apply while you hold that card), new abilities during downtime or social encounters, or even one-time benefits.

Each card includes five elements:

Level and Domain. The top left of the card indicates the card's level, followed by its domain symbol. You can only choose domain cards of your level or lower.

- Recall Cost. The top right of the card lists a number next to a lightning bolt symbol. This is the card's Recall Cost. This won't affect you at character creation, but once you reach level 5, you'll have more cards than you do space in your loadout (your set of active cards). When you want to move an inactive card from your vault to your loadout, you'll either need to do so during downtime, or mark the number of Stress indicated on the card to swap it immediately. See "Domain Cards" in chapter 2 for more details on using your loadout and vault.
- Type. Right above the card's title, the center of the card states its type. . There are three types of domain cards: abilities, spells, and grimoires. Abilities are typically mundane in nature, while Spells are magical in nature. Grimoires are unique to the Codex domain and are a collection of smaller spells bundled together. Some game mechanics only apply to one of these types of cards.

Effect. The text on the bottom half of the card describes its effect, including any special rules you need to follow when you use that card.

and increase your Evasion against this attack by its value.

# Class

During character creation, you'll choose one of this section, along with one of its subclasses. Your chosen class grants the following features:

- Domains. Each class lists which two domains serve as the basis for its abilities. This determines which domain decks you can choose cards from during character creation and when leveling up.
- Starting Evasion Score. Each class has its own starting Evasion"). When the GM makes an attack roll against you, this is the number they need to meet or beat in order to hit.
- Damage Threshold. Each class has a unique Damage Threshold (see "Damage Thresholds and Hit Points" in chapter 2). These determine how strong your class is against incoming attacks.

Class Items. Each class has a unique set of items they begin the game with.

Class Feature. Each class has a unique move (or set of moves) you can utilize during play.

Unique Hope Feature. Each class has a special move they can use by spending three Hope. These are named for the class, a la "Bard's Hope".

Your chosen subclass grants the following features:

Spellcast Trait. If you're a spellcaster, this is the character trait your subclass uses any time you're required to make a spellcast roll.

Foundation Feature. This feature is the unique move you gain from your subclass's Foundation card.

Specialization Feature. As you gain levels, you'll have a chance to choose your subclass's Specialization card, gaining a unique move (or set of moves) from it.

Mastery Feature. As you gain levels, you'll have a chance to choose your subclass's Mastery card, gaining a unique move (or set of moves) from it.

#### Bard

Those who become bards are truly the most charismatic members of this class are masters of captivation and may specialize in any of a variety of performance types, including: singing, playing musical instruments, weaving tales, or telling jokes. Whether performing to an audience or speaking to an individual, bards will excel. There are many schools and guilds where members of this profession come together to bond and train, but there is a fair amount of ego within those of the bardic persuasion. While they may be the most likely to bring people together, a bard of ill temper can just as easily tear a party apart.

#### Druid

Becoming a druid is more than an occupation, it's a calling to those who wish to learn from and protect the magic of the wilderness. Those druids who practice the often quiet work of channeling flora are likely to be underestimated; while those who channel the brutal forces of animals may be a terrifying thing to behold. Druids are known to cultivate in small groups, often connected by a specific ethos or locale. Through years of study and dedication, druids can learn to transform into beasts and shape the earth and all its organisms.
