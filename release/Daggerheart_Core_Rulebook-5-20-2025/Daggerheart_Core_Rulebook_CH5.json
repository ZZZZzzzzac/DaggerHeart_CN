Campaign frames with a lower complexity rating often sit squarely within the kind of genre Daggerheart is built for and don't have many additional mechanics to consider. Campaign frames with a higher complexity rating often push the genre of the campaign outside the bounds of traditional fantasy, contain more in-depth mechanics to implement, and require a GM who is comfortable creating new game elements (often known as \"homebrewing\")—such as stat blocks, equipment, and similar content—for their players.\n\nEach campaign frame includes the following sections.\n\n- A pitch to present to players\n- Suggestions for the campaign's tone, feel, themes, and cultural touchstones that helped shaped it\n- An overview of the campaign's background\n- Guidance for how certain communities, ancestries, and classes fit into the setting\n- Principles for players and GMs to consider during the campaign\n- Unique setting distinctions\n- An inciting incident to launch the campaign\n- Special mechanics to use during the campaign\n- Questions to consider during session zero\n\n*You can find each campaign frame map in the appendix or at www.daggerheart.com/downloads.*",

  "original": "## OVERVIEW\n\n*If your group decides to play this campaign, give your players the following information before character creation.*\n\n**Fanewick** is a wild and untamed land, long avoided by outside forces. The woods are dark and twisting, filled with Faint Divinities who perform small miracles and services for its inhabitants, but are just as likely to lure travelers off narrow paths to their ruin. Seemingly harmless expanses of field hide bogs that engulf entire armies, consuming heavy artillery as quickly as it can cross the border. This wilderness fosters hardy people who are bold enough to raise families where others have not and strictly follow the unique rules that keep them safe. These Wicklings remained insulated from their neighbors' wars until plague forced the people of Haven to desperate acts.\n\n**Haven** was once the most powerful force in the region; for centuries, the high stone walls into the capital bore the phrase \"The Godless Gate.\" While the original meaning has been lost to common knowledge, some dusty tomes and ancient records state that the founders of Haven wished to be free of the influence of the Faint Divinities that dominated the surrounding regions. They hatched a plan to kill one of the mightiest of these deities, known as **Shun'Aush the Granite Ophid**. While their exact method of deicide is forgotten, their victory ensured Haven's dominance in the region for centuries to come. They made their home behind his remains, which became the mighty walls that Haven is known for.\n\nBut Shun'Aush would have his revenge. As the Havenites carved through his stone body, the fine dust left behind settled into the surrounding earth. There was a time of prosperity over many centuries while the scales of the god remained undisturbed. But progress is its own pressure. The growing population demanded increased productivity, and as farmers tilled deeper soil and miners hacked into hidden stone, the ancient stone dust rose to the surface. The same walls that brought the city security became the crucible that incubated a virulent plague.\n\nOver the last two years, over half of Haven's populace fell to a disease known as the **Serpent's Sickness**. First, victims cough up dust. Soon after, their skin breaks out in a scaling rash. Finally, their body hardens—first the flesh, bones, and soft tissue, spreading until, finally, their organs ossify. Once within the organs, \"the serpent\" moves so quickly that sufferers petrify where they stand, filling Haven with statues of victims in their last moments of agony.\n\nThe High Magus of Haven, **Archmage Phylax**, discovered a rare red flower called the crimson lady's veil that could cure the Serpent's Sickness. These buds grow prolifically across Fanewick in the spring—but for every ten thousand of the common white-petaled blossoms, only one red flower blooms.\n\nDesperate to save their people from the plague, Haven invaded Fanewick to amass the scarce red buds. Their forces plunged into the deep wood and, under the guidance of Archmage Phylax, plucked out the **Reaping Eye** from the most powerful Faint Divinity that protected the land: **The Great Owl Nikta**, the Shepherd of the Seasons. The Shepherd kept Fanewick in balance by turning her eyes upon the land, first for ripening, then ruination. Thus Nikta maintained the cycle of seasons—of growth and decay, of death and rebirth. With her Reaping Eye removed, Nikta can only watch over Fanewick with the **Sowing Eye**, forcing the land into everlasting spring.\n\nIn the year since, Haven has conquered the bogs, turning them into fields to harvest red flowers. The endless growth that once seemed like a gift quickly evolved into a scourge known as the **Witherwild**—Fanewick's flora and fauna flourished, unchecked and uncontrolled. Animals swell to massive size; trees warp, twist, and begin to hunt people; and vines creep along the forest floor, strangling all they touch. This explosive growth is unconquerable and unrelenting, with no force able to stop the burgeoning verdance for long.\n\nPrior to the Serpent's Sickness and the Shepherd's endless growth, your party lived a peaceful life in Fanewick or a life of toil and conquest in Haven. But when the danger demands a response, even the unprepared—and unwilling—must make a stand.",

  "context": "## 概述\n\n*如果你的团队决定进行此战役，请在角色创建前将以下信息告知玩家。*\n\n**法恩威克（Fanewick）**是一片蛮荒之地，长期以来被外界势力所回避。这里的森林黑暗扭曲，充满了微弱神祇（Faint Divinities），他们为当地居民行使小小的奇迹和服务，但也同样可能引诱旅行者偏离狭窄的小路走向毁灭。看似无害的广阔田野下隐藏着吞噬整支军队的沼泽，它们吞噬重型火炮的速度与它们跨越边境的速度一样快。这片荒野孕育了坚韧的人民，他们大胆地在此地繁衍后代，严格遵循独特的规则以确保自身安全。这些威克林（Wicklings）与邻国的战争隔绝开来，直到一场瘟疫迫使海文（Haven）人民采取绝望的行动。\n\n**海文（Haven）**曾是该地区最强大的势力；几个世纪以来，通往首都的巍峨石墙上刻着“无神之门”的字样。虽然其原始含义已不为人所知，但一些落满灰尘的古籍和记录表明，海文的奠基者希望摆脱统治周边地区的微弱神祇的影响。他们策划了一个杀死其中一位最强大神祇的计划，这位神祇被称为**花岗岩蛇怪舒恩奥什（Shun'Aush the Granite Ophid）**。虽然他们弑神的确切方法已遗忘，但他们的胜利确保了海文在未来几个世纪在该地区的统治地位。他们将家园建在他遗骸的后面，这些遗骸成为了海文闻名于世的宏伟城墙。\n\n但舒恩奥什会报复。当海文人凿穿他的石体时，留下的细尘落入周围的土地。在神祇的鳞片未被打扰的许多世纪里，海文曾有过一段繁荣时期。但进步本身就是一种压力。不断增长的人口需要提高生产力，当农民耕得更深，矿工凿入隐藏的石头时，古老的石尘升至地表。带来城市安全的城墙变成了滋生致命瘟疫的温床。\n\n在过去两年里，超过一半的海文居民死于一种被称为**蛇之病（Serpent's Sickness）**的疾病。首先，受害者咳出灰尘。不久之后，他们的皮肤长出鳞状皮疹。最后，他们的身体变硬——首先是血肉、骨骼和软组织，然后扩散开来，直到最终，他们的器官骨化。一旦进入器官，“蛇”移动得如此之快，以至于患者在原地石化，海文因此充满了受害者在临终痛苦中的雕像。\n\n海文的大法师，**大法师菲拉克斯（Archmage Phylax）**，发现了一种罕见的红色花朵，名为猩红淑女面纱（crimson lady's veil），可以治愈蛇之病。这些花蕾在春天在法恩威克大量生长——但每万朵常见的白色花瓣花朵中，只有一朵红花绽放。\n\n为了绝望地拯救他们的人民免受瘟疫之苦，海文入侵法恩威克以收集稀有的红色花蕾。他们的部队深入森林，在大法师菲拉克斯的引导下，从保护这片土地的最强大的微弱神祇：季节的牧羊人**大猫头鹰尼克塔（The Great Owl Nikta）**那里，拔出了**收割之眼（Reaping Eye）**。牧羊人通过将她的眼睛投向大地来维持法恩威克的平衡，先是成熟，然后是毁灭。因此，尼克塔维持着季节的循环——生长与衰败，死亡与重生。随着她的收割之眼被移除，尼克塔只能用**播种之眼（Sowing Eye）**照看法恩威克，迫使这片土地进入永恒的春天。\n\n一年以来，海文征服了沼泽，将它们变成了收获红色花朵的田地。曾经看似是馈赠的无尽生长迅速演变成了一种被称为**枯萎荒野（Witherwild）**的灾祸——法恩威克的动植物群肆无忌惮地繁盛，不受控制。动物变得巨大；树木扭曲变形，开始捕猎人类；藤蔓沿着森林地面蔓延，勒死它们触及的一切。这种爆炸性的生长是不可征服和无情的，没有任何力量能够长期阻止勃发的绿色。\n\n在蛇之病和牧羊人的无尽生长之前，你的队伍在法恩威克过着平静的生活，或者在海文过着辛劳和征服的生活。但当危险需要回应时，即使是毫无准备——且不情愿——的人也必须挺身而出。"

Locals claim he leads those who displease him or harm nocturnal creatures into dangerous terrain. It's rumored that he watches over Fanewick nights from his home on the moon.\n\n**Qui'Gar, Whispered Sweetness for a Thorny End:** A quiet god who presides over the deaths of those who pass in thorny bushes and briar patches. Traditionally, she doesn't receive many visitors, but the Witherwild's corruptive growth has made her job harder and upended her quiet existence.\n\n**Rohkin, the Wandering Horn:** Rohkin watches over the many herds of horned creatures that reside in Fanewick. In happier times, he preserved the balance of nature and civilization, preventing overhunting. But since the corruption of the Witherwild has taken hold, he's seen his herds change into unrecognizable, dangerous beasts.\n\nThese are but a small slice of the hundreds, if not thousands, of Faint Divinities lurking, relaxing, hunting, and playing throughout Fanewick.\n\n- What Faint Divinities do the PCs acknowledge and pay tribute to, if any?\n- How has the Witherwild changed the outlook, personality, and dispositions of the Faint Divinities the characters encounter?\n- Which gods ally themselves with Haven to preserve the endless spring?

Kreil has never agreed—at least not openly—with **Archmage Phylax's** (they/them) decision to steal the Reaping Eye, and the consequences they've all paid for that decision have been grimly vindicating.\n\nRecently, Kreil uncovered the Fanewraith's plot and is horrified by the possibility of her success. Knowing he can't send a troop of Haven soldiers deep into the woods to hunt down and stop the Fanewraith from stealing the Sowing Eye, Kreil uses his vast network of informants and spies to find a group of adventurers who can bring the Fanewraith to swift justice.\n\nThe party is sent an invitation from Haven to meet with Kreil. But is his information correct? Does he have his own motivation or secret ambition? Whether they come from Fanewick or Haven, the party must extend some trust to a person who is equally as dangerous and mercurial as the \"enemy\" they pursue.

  "original": "## OVERVIEW\n\n*If your group decides to play this campaign, give your players the following information before character creation.*\n\nThe following five nations comprise the continent of Althas:\n\n**Armada** is a federation of city-states founded by piratesturned-merchants. Uninterested in paying back the fortunes stolen by their forebears, they seek strength and recognition through naval superiority. Armada is allied with Jesthaen and is disliked by Voldaen and Hilltop.\n\n**Hilltop** is a rich theocracy that exerts a monopoly on access to the gods, giving them holdings in the other nations' settlements from capitals down to villages. Hilltop is an old ally of Voldaen and is unfriendly toward Armada and Jesthaen.\n\n**Jesthaen** is a young republic recently independent from Voldaen after a bloody but short war. They seek to prove their strength through displays of military might. Jesthaen is allied with Armada and allies of convenience with Polaris.\n\n**Polaris** is a progress-focused magocracy at the beginning of a magical industrial revolution. They are ideological rivals with Voldaen and allies of convenience with Jesthaen.\n\n**Voldaen** is a proud monarchy with traditional authority and riches, recently shaken by Jesthaen's secession. They are an old ally of Hilltop and ideological rivals of Polaris.\n\nThese five nations once flew under one banner. In the age of gods, the divinities protected their mortal creations, clashing with primordial powers of chaos and striking them down. With victory secured, the peoples of Althas crowned their first queen—a dwarven seraph named Arvold—and founded the nation of Voldaen. Meanwhile, the gods established their seat in what is now known as Hilltop, but departed centuries later to fight otherworldly foes.\n\nOver the next several centuries, factional differences within Voldaen grew untenable. With the gods absent, their priests asserted their authority as divine regents of Hilltop. Later, a group of scholars and mages who wished to push the boundaries of arcane knowledge broke off and founded the nation of Polaris. Alliances of pirate navies began settling down in trade cities, forming the federation of Armada. And just fifteen years ago, groups of workers and anti-monarchists declared independence from Voldaen to establish their own nation, known as Jesthaen. This bloody revolution consumed the continent, with Hilltop coming to Voldaen's aid while Polaris and Armada supported the Jesthaen rebels. Active combat ended five years ago with an armistice, but the peace remains tenuous.\n\nThe emergence of Jesthaen as a nascent military force has redrawn the lines of power, challenging Voldaen and Hilltop's traditional authority. But the alliance between Polaris and the upstart nations of Armada and Jesthaen is fragile, and there are many in both Voldaen and Jesthaen with unfinished business from the war. Minor border clashes and trade disputes threaten to boil over. Many believe that war is coming again—it's only a matter of when and how.\n\nFive Banners Burning is an emotionally intense campaign with a large cast and sweeping scope, where the characters will find themselves in the crucible that forges the fate of nations. The campaign leans toward a nuanced moral landscape, with morality and ethics in tension with duty and allegiance. Heroes may do terrible things that weigh upon them, and most villains are motivated by love and loyalty as often as ambition or vengeance.\n\n![](_page_263_Picture_13.jpeg)",

  "context": "## 概述\n\n*如果您的团队决定进行此战役，请在创建角色之前向玩家提供以下信息。*\n\n以下五个国家构成了阿尔塔斯大陆：\n\n**阿玛达（Armada）** 是由海盗转型商人建立的城邦联邦。他们不愿偿还祖先掠夺的财富，而是通过海军优势寻求力量和认可。阿玛达与杰斯塔恩（Jesthaen）结盟，并与沃尔丹（Voldaen）和山顶（Hilltop）不和。\n\n**山顶（Hilltop）** 是一个富裕的神权国度，垄断了通往神祇的途径，这使得他们在其他国家的定居点，从首都到村庄都有势力。山顶是沃尔丹的旧盟友，对阿玛达和杰斯塔恩不友好。\n\n**杰斯塔恩（Jesthaen）** 是一个年轻的共和国，在经历了一场血腥但短暂的战争后，最近从沃尔丹独立出来。他们试图通过展示军事力量来证明自己的实力。杰斯塔恩与阿玛达结盟，并与波拉里斯（Polaris）是方便之盟。\n\n**波拉里斯（Polaris）** 是一个专注于进步的魔法政体，正处于魔法工业革命的开端。他们与沃尔丹是意识形态上的对手，并与杰斯塔恩是方便之盟。\n\n**沃尔丹（Voldaen）** 是一个拥有传统权威和财富的骄傲君主国，最近因杰斯塔恩的分裂而动摇。他们是山顶的旧盟友，也是波拉里斯的意识形态对手。\n\n这五个国家曾在一个旗帜下。在神祇时代，神明保护着他们凡间的造物，与混沌的原始力量对抗并将其击败。胜利确保后，阿尔塔斯的人民加冕了他们的第一位女王——一位名叫阿沃尔德（Arvold）的矮人炽天使——并建立了沃尔丹国。与此同时，神明在现在被称为山顶的地方建立了他们的宝座，但几个世纪后为了对抗异界敌人而离开了。\n\n在接下来的几个世纪里，沃尔丹内部的派系分歧变得难以维持。随着神祇的缺席，他们的祭司们作为神圣摄政者在山顶 asserting their authority. 后来，一群渴望突破奥术知识界限的学者和法师分裂出来，建立了波拉里斯国。海盗海军联盟开始在贸易城市定居，组成了阿玛达联邦。而就在十五年前，一群工人和反君主主义者宣布从沃尔丹独立，建立了他们自己的国家，称为杰斯塔恩。这场血腥的革命席卷了整个大陆，山顶援助了沃尔丹，而波拉里斯和阿玛达则支持了杰斯塔恩叛军。五年前，随着停战协议的签署，积极的战斗结束了，但和平依然脆弱。\n\n杰斯塔恩作为一个新兴军事力量的出现重新划分了权力界限，挑战了沃尔丹和山顶的传统权威。但波拉里斯与阿玛达和杰斯塔恩这两个新贵国家的联盟是脆弱的，沃尔丹和杰斯塔恩都有许多人在战争中留有未竟之事。微小的边境冲突和贸易纠纷随时可能爆发。许多人相信战争即将再次到来——这只是时间和方式的问题。\n\n《五旗燃火》（Five Banners Burning）是一场情感 intense 的战役，拥有众多角色和宏大的范围，角色们将发现自己处于塑造国家命运的熔炉之中。战役倾向于 nuanced 的道德景观，道德和伦理与职责和忠诚之间存在 tension。英雄们可能会做出让他们背负重担的可怕事情，大多数反派的动机也常常是爱和忠诚，而非野心或复仇。\n\n![](_page_263_Picture_13.jpeg)"

  "original": "## THE INCITING INCIDENT\n\n*You can use the prompt below to start your campaign, or create your own.*\n\n**Clover of Towers** (orderborne firbolg, they/them), the child of Jesthaen revolutionary hero **Adamant Towers** (orderborne firbolg, she/her), was kidnapped on the way to a political marriage to **Enchanter Kalashae** (loreborne orc, she/her), a rising star in Polaris's High Circle of mages.\n\nPolaris is wary of Jesthaen's claim that Clover has been kidnapped and demands that Jesthaen follow through with the political marriage. Voldaen denies all involvement and sends a diplomatic investigative party to Lightning Valley, a border town known both for the giant lightning rods that protect the town from magical storms and for hosting the talks that ended official hostilities between Voldaen and the revolutionary faction. However, days later, reports tell of some kind of \"disaster\" during the initial meetings between Voldaen and Jesthaen's representatives.\n\nThe party is sent to Lightning Valley to investigate what happened. There, they find representatives from other nations doing the same—the apprentice of a disappeared mageinquisitor, a divine seeker from Hilltop investigating potential divine implications, a Voldaen judge who once served as the town magistrate \"returning to visit family,\" and a merchantdiplomat from Armada.\n\nThe following NPCs comprise the cast embroiled in this mystery:\n\n**Clover of Towers** wants to make their mother proud and find a way to be happy far from home. Before their kidnapping, they were last seen drinking with city guards at the Three Poles tavern, built between several lightning poles. They were too young to fight in the war, and they have a sense of inferiority about not having bled for the freedom they now enjoy.\n\n**Oziver of Storms**, sheriff of Lightning Valley (ridgeborne simiah, he/him), is trying to keep the peace but is quickly becoming overwhelmed by the attention and stakes. Oziver is eager for help but needs reassurance of any outsider's goodwill. He knows that a city guard was the last to be seen with Clover, but he's convinced the still-missing guard isn't to blame.\n\n**Cerulean Prism**, apprentice Mage-Inquisitor of Polaris (loreborne clank, he/him), is quiet and diligent, though worried by Clover's sudden disappearance. While working for Enchanter Kalashae, Cerulean managed correspondence with Clover during the marriage negotiations. They've fallen for the firbolg and will take reckless action to find them.\n\n**Kostren**, Seeker of Hilltop (orderborne halfling, she/her), is a formidable presence used to being obeyed. She takes over the local temple as her base of operations, conscripting the clergy for a divination ritual that will locate Clover. She tells anyone that will listen of her vision that \"proves\" foul play by the mages of Polaris. Kostren is exaggerating the certainty of this vision to stoke renewed conflict so that Hilltop can claim more fertile land.\n\n**Zeshthon**, County Judge of Voldaen (highborne dwarf, they/them), is an elderly dwarf with a compelling silence about them that people can't help but fill with conversation. They volunteered for the inquiry so they could visit their grandniece, a cobbler residing in the town. A dedicated art collector, Zesthon hopes to procure embargoed tapestries from Goledraelle, which could lead to exposing the merchant's true identity as a spy.\n\n**Goledraelle**, merchant of Armada (seaborne elf, he/him), is a charming but hapless-seeming textiles merchant. This image of incompetence is a cover he deploys to throw off suspicion of his true agenda; in truth, Goledraelle is an Armadan spy dispatched to ensure the marriage happens as planned.\n\nThe original investigators arrived two days after Clover's disappearance and set out into the hills to the east, but have not checked in for over a week. Did they suffer the same fate as the firbolg? What help from the townsfolk did the kidnappers have, and who else knows about it? Which enemies of Jesthaen, Polaris, or Armada were in position to sabotage the marriage? Was the marriage sabotaged by someone within Jesthaen for other reasons?\n\nDid some danger or threat lead Clover from the town without their escort? Or was this part of Clover's plan all along, a chance to live free of their mother's expectations?\n\nWhich of the second wave of investigators will be the first to learn where Clover went? Who escalates to violence first, and what version of that story catches on like wildfire?",

  "context": "## 煽动性事件\n\n*您可以使用以下提示作为战役的开端，或创建您自己的故事。*\n\n**高塔的苜蓿**（Orderborne firbolg，性别为他们/她们），是 Jesthaen 革命英雄 **Adamant Towers**（Orderborne firbolg，性别为她）的孩子。在前往与 Polaris 法师高阶议会新星 **附魔师 Kalashae**（Loreborne orc，性别为她）政治联姻的途中，苜蓿被绑架了。\n\nPolaris 对 Jesthaen 声称苜蓿被绑架的说法表示怀疑，并要求 Jesthaen 按原计划进行政治联姻。Voldaen 否认所有牵连，并派遣了一个外交调查团前往闪电谷，这个边境小镇以其保护小镇免受魔法风暴的巨大避雷针以及曾作为结束 Voldaen 与革命派别之间正式敌对状态的谈判地点而闻名。然而，几天后，有报道称 Voldaen 和 Jesthaen 代表之间的初步会谈中发生了某种“灾难”。\n\n队伍被派往闪电谷调查发生了什么。在那里，他们发现其他国家的代表也在做同样的事情——一位失踪的法师审判官的学徒，一位来自 Hilltop 调查潜在神圣影响的神圣寻求者，一位曾担任小镇治安官的 Voldaen 法官“回乡探亲”，以及一位来自 Armada 的商人外交官。\n\n以下 NPC 构成了卷入这场谜团的人物：\n\n**高塔的苜蓿** 希望让母亲感到骄傲，并找到一个远离家乡快乐生活的方式。在被绑架之前，最后一次见到他们/她们是在三杆酒馆与城防兵一起喝酒，这家酒馆建在几根避雷针之间。他们/她们在战争中年纪太小，无法参战，对未能为现在享受的自由流血感到自卑。\n\n**风暴的奥兹弗**，闪电谷治安官（Ridgeborne simiah，性别为他），正努力维持和平，但很快就被受到的关注和牵涉的利害关系压垮了。奥兹弗渴望得到帮助，但需要得到任何外来者善意的保证。他知道城防兵是最后见到苜蓿的人，但他确信这位仍然失踪的士兵不应受到责备。\n\n**蔚蓝棱镜**，Polaris 法师审判官学徒（Loreborne clank，性别为他），安静而勤奋，但对苜蓿的突然失踪感到担忧。在为附魔师 Kalashae 工作期间，蔚蓝棱镜在联姻谈判期间负责与苜蓿通信。他爱上了 firbolg，并将不顾一切地寻找他们/她们。\n\n**科斯特伦**，Hilltop 寻求者（Orderborne halfling，性别为她），是一位令人敬畏的存在，习惯于被人服从。她将当地的寺庙作为她的行动基地，征用神职人员进行一个占卜仪式来定位苜蓿。她告诉所有愿意听的人，她有一个“证明”Polaris 法师有不法行为的幻象。科斯特伦夸大了这个幻象的确定性，以煽动新的冲突，这样 Hilltop 就可以获得更多肥沃的土地。\n\n**泽斯顿**，Voldaen 县法官（Highborne dwarf，性别为他们/她们），是一位年迈的矮人，身上有一种令人着迷的沉默，人们忍不住会用交谈来填补。他们/她们自愿参加调查，以便拜访他们/她们的侄孙女，一位居住在镇上的鞋匠。泽斯顿是一位专注的艺术收藏家，希望从 Goledraelle 采购被禁运的挂毯，这可能揭露这位商人作为间谍的真实身份。\n\n**戈莱德莱**，Armada 商人（Seaborne elf，性别为他），是一位迷人但看似笨拙的纺织品商人。这种无能的形象是他用来掩盖其真实目的的伪装；实际上，戈莱德莱是 Armada 派出的间谍，目的是确保联姻按计划进行。\n\n最初的调查人员在苜蓿失踪两天后到达，并前往东部的山丘，但已经一个多星期没有消息了。他们是否遭遇了与 firbolg 相同的命运？绑架者得到了哪些镇民的帮助，还有谁知道这件事？哪些 Jesthaen、Polaris 或 Armada 的敌人可以破坏联姻？联姻是否因其他原因被 Jesthaen 内部的人破坏了？\n\n是否有某种危险或威胁导致苜蓿在没有护送的情况下离开了小镇？或者这是否一直是苜蓿计划的一部分，一个摆脱母亲期望的机会？\n\n第二波调查人员中，谁会第一个知道苜蓿去了哪里？谁会第一个升级到暴力，以及哪个版本的这个故事会像野火一样传播开来？</text_to_translate>"

  "original": "## OVERVIEW\n\n*If your group decides to play this campaign, give your players the following information before character creation.*\n\nLong ago, within the heart of the **Plover Caves**, **Hylaeus the Forest Mage** (she/her) cast a powerful spell, creating a Lure that draws dangerous creatures from the surrounding area into the caverns. For centuries, this kept any harm from coming to the village of **Elmore**. However, the caves are now filled to the brim with strange, unexpected creatures from across the region—and the remnants of outsiders brave or foolhardy enough to venture into them. But nobody from Elmore is foolish enough to be caught dead in the caves. The quiet, rustic village is full of bakers and weavers, farmers and cobblers, with ne'er a sword in sight. The villagers are more concerned about not mucking up their contribution to the yearly Stewpot Festival than the dangers outside their walls.\n\nThat was until the village's beloved halfling mayor **Doug Dougle** (he/him) was attacked by a dangerous creature during his daily hike through Plover Woods. The Lure created by Hylaeus all those years ago is fading, and with it, Elmore's protection. As increasingly dangerous beasts stalk the woods, the villagers have banded together to reignite the ancient spell, calling on anyone who might pick up a blade to descend into the caves and save their people. Unfortunately, the defenseless people of Elmore have ceased hunting and foraging in Plover Woods for fear of attack until the Lure is reactivated—there isn't much to spare, so every bite in town is precious. Anyone venturing into the caves will have to hunt and prepare their own food while they're down there!\n\nThe easiest way to find the Plover Caves is to take the western road out of Elmore and follow the birdsong of piping plovers. Old tales from this area say these small birds are the only creatures that move freely in and out of the tunnels without losing themselves to the depths, so following them almost always leads to an entrance—or an exit.\n\nThe old tales also say the Plover Caves are endless—this isn't true, but it might as well be. They stretch on for hundreds of miles underground, deeper and more sprawling than even the most adventurous explorer could map in their lifetime. The entry path leads down on a sharp decline for miles until it finally splits into many branches leading to various regions within the cave system. Here, different biomes are home to unique creatures, wonderous flora, and valuable treasures left behind by adventurers past. The deeper you go, the more dangerous and delicious the creatures are, and the more precious and powerful the treasure is. And even deeper still lies the Lure.\n\nThose from Elmore might be surprised to find there are many people happily living and working in the dark, dangerous caverns. Most reside in camps, but more permanent residents have small cabins carved out of rock along the tunnels. The culture in the Plover Caves is very communal, and ambitious folks have set up shops for bartering or trade. Most major caverns even host a Berry's—the chain of small restaurants that serve the catch of the day, fresh and hot, in exchange for gold. Residents might stop in when they're too tired or ingredient-poor to cook for themselves, but Berry's restaurants are also hubs for gossip, entertainment, and warnings about what dangerous beasts might be lurking\n\n![](_page_271_Picture_8.jpeg)",

  "context": "## 概述\n\n*如果你的团队决定进行这个战役，请在角色创建前向你的玩家提供以下信息。*\n\n很久以前，在**鸻鸟洞穴**的中心，**森林法师海莱乌斯**（她）施展了一个强大的法术，创造了一个诱饵，将周围区域的危险生物吸引到洞穴中。几个世纪以来，这使得**埃尔莫尔**村庄免受伤害。然而，这些洞穴现在已经挤满了来自该地区各地奇怪的、意想不到的生物——以及那些足够勇敢或足够鲁莽 venturing into them 的外来者的遗骸。但埃尔莫尔村庄里没有人会愚蠢到在洞穴里送死。这个安静、质朴的村庄里满是面包师和织工，农民和鞋匠，连一把剑都看不到。村民们更关心的是如何不在一年一度的炖锅节上搞砸他们的贡献，而不是墙外的危险。\n\n直到村里深受喜爱的半身人村长**道格·道格尔**（他）在普洛弗森林日常徒步时遭到一只危险生物的袭击。海莱乌斯多年前创造的诱饵正在消退，随之消退的是埃尔莫尔的保护。随着越来越危险的野兽潜伏在森林里，村民们团结起来，试图重新点燃古老的法术，呼吁任何可能拿起武器的人 descend into the caves 并拯救他们的人民。不幸的是，手无寸铁的埃尔莫尔村民出于对袭击的恐惧，已经停止在普洛弗森林中狩猎和觅食，直到诱饵重新激活——没有什么可多余的，所以镇上的每一口食物都弥足珍贵。任何 venture into the caves 的人必须在下面狩猎和准备自己的食物！\n\n找到鸻鸟洞穴最简单的方法是沿着埃尔莫尔村西边的路，跟着鸣叫的鸻鸟声。这个地区古老的传说说，这些小鸟是唯一可以在隧道内外自由移动而不迷失在深处的生物，所以跟着它们几乎总是能找到入口——或者出口。\n\n古老的传说还说鸻鸟洞穴是无尽的——这并不真实，但也差不多。它们在地下延伸数百英里，比最爱冒险的探险家一生所能绘制的地图还要深、还要广阔。入口向下陡峭倾斜数英里，直到最终分成许多分支，通往洞穴系统的各个区域。在这里，不同的生物群落是独特生物、奇妙植物和过去冒险家留下的宝贵宝藏的家园。你走得越深，生物就越危险、越美味，宝藏就越珍贵、越强大。而更深处则潜藏着诱饵。\n\n来自埃尔莫尔的人可能会惊讶地发现，有许多人在黑暗、危险的洞穴中快乐地生活和工作。大多数人住在营地里，但更永久的居民则在隧道沿线的岩石中凿出小型小屋。鸻鸟洞穴的文化非常 communal，有野心的人们在那里开设了以物易物或贸易的商店。大多数主要的洞穴甚至都有 Berry's——这家连锁小餐馆以金币换取当天新鲜热腾腾的捕获物。居民们太累或食材不足时可能会光顾这里自己做饭，但 Berry's 餐馆也是流言、娱乐以及危险野兽可能潜伏的警告的集散地。\n\n![](_page_271_Picture_8.jpeg)"

A windstorm might whip through the tunnels, uprooting massive plants and blocking exits. A sudden, excessive expulsion of moisture from the weeping skyflowers overhead might cause a torrential downpour that floods a cave. A cavern's ground might be so soft and thick that you begin to sink if you stand still too long. Some even refer to the Plover Caves as a distinct entity itself—not just a cave system, but a massive creature of its own.\n\nAdditionally, there are distinct features within the caves most adventurers will stumble across:\n\n**Layers** of the cavern represent how deep an adventurer is within the Plover Caves, with each layer representing between 200 and 500 vertical feet. Common adventurers generally stay within the first layer, but the most ambitious venture deeper. Most stories describe four distinct layers (The Shallows, Twilight, Abyss, and Hadral), but veteran explorers have told tales of many, many more.\n\n**Brilliance** is a geodesic dome that shines so brightly it mimics the sunlight from the outside world. Some veteran explorers practice meditation and morning rituals in this dome, often asking one another, \"Will you be at Brilliance today?\"\n\n**Reflection of the Stars** is Plover Caves' primary lake. It's fed by an underground spring and sits beneath a ceiling dotted with bioluminescent morsels, such as the glowing mantis and the brightclaw scorpion. The aquatic creatures who call this place home range from small almond guppies to medium-sized jellyfish to the dreaded ironshark and the massive angler squid, whose many eyes are considered a delicacy.\n\n**The Catacombs** are the deepest point of the third layer of the cavern, thus named because the ground is covered in so many layers of bones, one cannot step without breaking a few and drawing attention to themself. Some of Plover Caves' residents say the most horrifying beasts bring their prey to the Catacombs for consumption, making it a hotbed of dangerous creatures. Passing through the Catacombs successfully is the only way to explore deeper than the Abyss.",

  "original": "## Making a Feast!\n\nDuring downtime, players can't choose downtime moves to clear Stress, clear Hit Points, or gain Hope. Instead, they have a new downtime move: Make a Feast. When they choose this move, the PCs can contribute any ingredients they're carrying to the party's collective meal and gain the benefits of the resulting feast.\n\nThe PCs who choose to Make a Feast during downtime prepare the food together. They should collaborate to decide which ingredients they're using, then erase those ingredients from their inventory. Then they come up with a name and description for the dish and record it in their party's cookbook.\n\nWhen the PCs begin cooking, they roll the appropriate number of flavor dice. For example, the party decides to make a steak dinner with the following recipe:\n\n- 1 serving of direbear meat → 3d12\n- 1 serving of mushroom caps → 2d12 + 1d8\n- 1 serving of ooze marrow → 2d8 + 1d4\n\nThis gives the party 5d12, 3d8, and 1d4 as the meal's flavor dice. They roll the dice and look for any matching values. If there are no matching values, they discard a single die of their choice, then roll the pool again to continue cooking. When they get any number of matching values, players collect those dice off to the side and continue rolling. When they have only one die left, the meal is done!\n\nNext, players take each set of matched dice (which can consist of two or more dice per set) and add their values together. For example, a d6 and a d8 that rolled matching 3s would be worth 3. A d10 and d12 that rolled matching 4s would be worth 4. A d8 and a d20 that rolled matching 4s (on a different roll) would also be worth 4. Together, they have a Meal Rating of 11.\n\nAll PCs who eat the meal can individually use the value of the Meal Rating to clear Hit Points, clear Stress, and gain Hope, dividing this value however they'd like. For example, with a Meal Rating of 11, one PC might choose to clear 6 Hit Points, clear 4 Stress, and gain 1 Hope. Another might choose to clear 5 Hit Points, clear 4 Stress, and gain 2 Hope.\n\nAnytime a party makes a dish with the same flavor profile as another recipe they've previously recorded in their cookbook, they should add a number of tokens equal to the party's current tier to their pool of flavor dice. When they must discard a die, they can instead discard one of these tokens.",

  "original": "## OVERVIEW\n\n*If your group decides to play this campaign, give your players the following information before character creation.*\n\nThe **Age of Umbra** is a dark and broken age within the realm known as the Halcyon Domain, which rots in the wake of its Pantheon's abandonment. Grandiose cities and awe-inspiring cathedrals to the Veiled Gods now crumble slowly into ruin, fallen bastions of the prosperous epoch ruled by the guiding hand of God-King Othedias. Othedias, chosen by the Veiled Gods as the bridge to divinity, conspired with his Grand Ordinants and Aetherlords to enact clandestine machinations that could shift the balance in celestial power, enraging the pantheon.\n\nHis blasphemy was met with cataclysmic retribution. The gods rained destruction upon the land, ending the Old World and forsaking the surviving peoples of the Halcyon Domain to an existence of growing desolation. The Veiled Gods then abandoned this world in what is referred to as the Apostasy, leaving what remains to wither under ever-growing shadow, the clouded skies growing darker with each passing generation as they herald the world's slow death march into entropy and oblivion.\n\nThe cycle of the soul has been sundered, cursing all who live or ever will live with the \"soul blight,\" a mark upon every mortal ensuring that, upon their death, they will rise again as a corrupted revenant bent on destroying everything they loved in their former life. If their risen body is destroyed, the marked soul withdraws into the dark, ethereal mass known as the Umbra, seeking others to haunt and corrupt.\n\nIt's now been nearly a century within the Age of Umbra, and those who remain rebuild what they can among the ruins of the Old World. Referring to themselves as the Enduring, these scattered communities of survivors huddle within reinforced battlements where Sacred Pyres burn as a beacon of hope and safety. All Enduring are trained to survive and defend themselves in this bleak land from a young age, many honed into fierce warriors and Aetherweavers through hardship and necessity by the time they reach adulthood. Bands of hunters brave the cracked and twisted landscape beyond their walls each day to gather sustenance, recover materials, and connect or trade with other surviving settlements.\n\nHowever, many of the outside world's wandering beasts have mutated from the corruption of the Umbra; this transient storm of twisted souls merges with and contorts the creatures into nightmarish monsters that stalk, rage, and evolve with each newly fused specter. When these monstrosities slay those who confront the wilds, their victims' blighted souls join the horrors that claimed them. In the absence of the gods, dreams turn ominous and empty, and oracles imagine great alien minds glimpsing into this world, reaching beyond the cosmic veil left unguarded.\n\nThe diaspora of surviving communities hold against the doom through grit, ingenuity, and faith. Within the swampy flood plains of the mountain-crowned region known as the **Idol Hollows**, an emergent fort village called **Okros** has stood resilient against the surrounding swampland dangers for over fifty years. Its massive walls of melted shields and stone encircle the village and central Sacred Pyre, whose flames climb above the tallest ramparts, a burning symbol of strength and safety visible from across the Idol Hollows.\n\nA recent seismic event within the valley conjured a massive sinkhole referred to as the **Shalk Chasm**, uncovering an expanse of long-buried structures and vestiges from before the Old World. Concerned and curious about what boons or banes might await discovery within this subterranean catacomb, brave Enduring slowly investigate the mysteries below, while scouts seek allies from erudite places, such as the Celsians of Amber Reach.\n\nNestled against the **Griefcleft Mountains** that buttress the eastern edge of the Idol Hollows, dividing it from the tainted jungles of Aveidoora, the glorious city of **Amber Reach** lays fallen and haunted in the wake of the Apostasy. The onceprosperous capital's expansive cityscape of overbearing gates, gothic towers, and staggering fortresses lies damaged and derelict, with empty households now sheltering horrors and looters. Within the city's Ashcall Quarter, the **Celsian Athenaeum**, a grand college and library repurposed into a stronghold, still holds against the dark. Here, hundreds of Enduring work against the deadly spirits and ghastly killers that torment the city ruins, seeking to reclaim control of Amber Reach's streets. A rising faction of hedonic, ruthless scoundrels and raiders known as the Damask Queens expand their territory from the far side of the debris-strewn Cinnabar Quarter, their crossings with the Celsians growing more violent with each encounter.\n\nAs despondent as existence may seem in the Halcyon Domain, within these communities of the Enduring, hope continuously sparks aflame. Whispers speak of remnants of divine power lingering within lost shrines and holy sites that can rebuke the soul blight. Rumors spread between settlements of heroic figures felling greater evils and reclaiming ancient relics for the might of the Enduring. Spirited leaders and champions rouse their fellow Enduring with promises of expanding their walls and avenging their fallen. Zealot factions fervently seek means to commune with the absent gods, forever searching for ways to repent for Othedias's crimes. Those who can access the Aetherweave see visions of distant sanctums and uncorrupted fanes that cast aside the clouded skies to preserve light and life—or even redeem those touched by the soul blight. Hermetic societies claim to carry tomes and truths of God-King Othedias and his great tragedy, along with prophecies that speak of a chance at salvation for the realm.

  "context": "## 概述\n\n*如果你的团队决定进行这场战役，请在角色创建前向你的玩家提供以下信息。*\n\n**幽影纪元**是被称为“宁静领域”的疆域内一个黑暗而破败的时代，它在其万神殿的抛弃后腐朽不堪。曾经宏伟壮丽的城市和令人敬畏的隐匿之神大教堂如今正缓慢地崩塌成废墟，这些是神王奥西迪亚斯指引下繁荣时代的沦陷堡垒。奥西迪亚斯被隐匿之神选为通往神性的桥梁，他与他的大执事和以太领主密谋进行秘密的阴谋，试图改变天界力量的平衡，激怒了万神殿。\n\n他的亵渎行为招致了灾难性的报应。众神降下毁灭，终结了旧世界，并将宁静领域的幸存者遗弃在日益荒凉的境地。随后，隐匿之神抛弃了这个世界，这被称为“背弃”，让剩余的一切在不断增长的阴影下凋零，乌云密布的天空随着每一代的过去而变得更加黑暗，预示着世界缓慢走向熵和遗忘的死亡行军。\n\n灵魂的循环已被割裂，诅咒着所有活着或将要活着的生灵，使他们染上“灵魂枯萎”，这是一个标记在每个凡人身上的印记，确保他们在死后会再次崛起，成为一个腐化的亡魂，一心要摧毁他们前生所爱的一切。如果他们复活的身体被摧毁，这个被标记的灵魂就会退回到被称为“幽影”的黑暗、虚幻的物质中，寻找其他人来困扰和腐化。\n\n如今，幽影纪元已经过去了近一个世纪，那些幸存下来的人们在旧世界的废墟中重建他们力所能及的一切。这些分散的幸存者社区称自己为“坚韧者”，他们聚集在加固的城墙内，神圣之火在那里燃烧，作为希望和安全的灯塔。所有坚韧者从小就被训练在这个荒凉的土地上生存和自卫，许多人在成年时通过艰辛和必要性磨练成了凶猛的战士和以太织者。每天都有猎人队伍冒险穿越城墙外裂缝密布、扭曲的景观，收集食物、回收材料，并与其他幸存的定居点建立联系或进行贸易。\n\n然而，许多外部世界的游荡野兽已经被幽影的腐化所变异；这股扭曲灵魂的短暂风暴与生物融合并扭曲它们，使其变成噩梦般的怪物，它们潜伏、狂暴，并随着每一个新融合的幽灵而进化。当这些怪物杀死那些面对荒野的人时，它们的受害者被枯萎的灵魂就会加入那些吞噬了它们的可怖存在。在众神缺席的情况下，梦境变得不祥而空虚，神谕者想象着伟大的异类心灵窥视着这个世界，触及那些无人看守的宇宙面纱之外。\n\n幸存社区的散居者们凭借毅力、智慧和信仰抵抗着厄运。在被称为**偶像空地**的山脉环绕地区的沼泽泛滥平原中，一个新兴的堡垒村庄**奥克罗斯**已经坚韧地抵抗了周围沼泽地的危险超过五十年。它由熔化的盾牌和石头组成的巨大城墙环绕着村庄和中央的神圣之火，火焰高过最高的城墙，是偶像空地各地都能看到的强大和安全的燃烧象征。\n\n山谷中最近的一次地震事件引发了一个巨大的天坑，被称为**沙尔克深渊**，揭示了一片埋藏已久的结构和旧世界之前的遗迹。对在这个地下墓穴中可能等待发现的福祉或灾祸既担忧又好奇，勇敢的坚韧者们正在缓慢地调查下面的谜团，而侦察兵则在寻求来自博学之地，例如琥珀湾的塞西亚人，的盟友。\n\n紧靠着构筑偶像空地东缘的**悲伤裂谷山脉**，将其与被污染的阿维多拉丛林隔开，辉煌的**琥珀湾**城在背弃之后沦陷并被鬼魂困扰。这座曾经繁荣的首都庞大的城景，拥有傲人的城门、哥特式高塔和令人惊叹的堡垒，如今破损不堪，荒废无人，空荡荡的房屋现在庇护着恐怖和掠夺者。在城市的灰烬召唤区，**塞西亚学园**，一所宏伟的学院和图书馆被改造成了据点，仍然坚守着黑暗。在这里，数百名坚韧者正在与那些折磨城市废墟的致命幽灵和可怕杀手作斗争，试图夺回琥珀湾街道的控制权。一股享乐主义、冷酷无情的恶棍和袭击者新势力，被称为“锦缎女王”，正在从布满瓦砾的朱砂区远端扩大她们的地盘，她们与塞西亚人的冲突每次都变得更加暴力。\n\n尽管宁静领域的生活可能看起来如此绝望，但在这些坚韧者的社区中，希望之火却不断燃起。耳语流传着关于遗失的神龛和圣地中残留的神圣力量可以驱除灵魂枯萎的说法。定居点之间流传着英雄人物击败更强大的邪恶并为坚韧者的力量夺回古代遗物的谣言。充满活力的领袖和勇士们用扩大城墙和为牺牲者复仇的承诺激励着他们的同胞坚韧者。狂热派系热切地寻求与缺席的众神沟通的方法，永远寻找为奥西迪亚斯的罪行赎罪的途径。那些能够进入以太织境的人看到了遥远的圣所和未被腐化的圣殿的景象，它们驱散了乌云密布的天空，以保留光明和生命——甚至救赎那些被灵魂枯萎触碰的人。隐秘的社团声称拥有关于神王奥西迪亚斯和他巨大悲剧的典籍和真相，以及预言着领域有救赎机会的预言。大地可能黑暗，但光点却燃烧得如此明亮。"

It is in these places that factions of thieves and thugs thrive, whether in the employ of the leadership, or by eroding them from below.\n\nHighborne communities within the Age of Umbra are extremely rare, and are often either based on the ghost of an Old World political power or a newly forged tyranny built on recovered or stolen resources.

Who do you trust the least?\n\nSlyborne characters are skulkers and thieves who flourish alongside those of influence or wealth across the land. Whether they work for highborne factions that try to maintain power or manipulate them for personal gain, those who know how to remain unnoticed or unexploited excel at seizing opportunities. Many slyborne characters also make a name for themselves as scouts or messengers between settlements, trading in goods or rumors as they go. Others still could be members of roguish communities such as the Damask Queens of the Amber Reach, self-crowned leaders in the lawless echo of bygone power.\n\n- You've built a rapport with a highborne figure.

  "original": "## OVERVIEW\n\n*If your group decides to play this campaign, give your players the following information before character creation.*\n\nThe **Echo Vale** is so named because its people live among the remains—the \"echoes\"—of a fallen civilization and attempt to use ancient technology for new purposes. In the hundreds of years since the fallen ones' mysterious annihilation, the steel and concrete of the old world succumbed to the plants and animals of the valley. Grasses grew in the cracks of ancient roads, trees made homes in derelict skyscrapers, and history forgot the names of figures depicted in crumbling statues, leaving those who built homes in the husks of these once-great cities to muddle their way through the powerful programs and machines left behind.\n\nNow, formidable settlements such as **Argent** make home among decaying ruins, building walls to keep violence out and workers in. Meanwhile, **Carrowcroft Walkaway** and other wandering cities move through the valley on all manner of vehicles, towns atop lumbering machines like travelers hauling their packs.\n\nAbove the valley lies the **Network**, a dense web of glimmering metal wire that shepherds information and communication across the disparate cities of the Echo Vale. Though the valley's inhabitants have long used this ancient technology, the complex language used to create and modify the network was lost when the previous civilization fell.\n\nThroughout the Echo Vale roam autonomous machines of the fallen world, called **remnants**. These automatons come in two primary forms. Some resemble animals, with features that match their living counterparts. Others were designed with a function in mind, such as defenders, builders, watchers, or domestic laborers that carried out tasks alongside their long-dead creators. Some remnants live within cities and are considered \"tame,\" while others roam \"wild\" in the Wastes, often territorial and hunting for sources of energy. Some are large enough to hold entire wandering cities on their backs, while others are small creatures that serve no apparent function aside from supplying scrap parts for the working machines people need to use each day.\n\nThese machines gain energy from a variety of sources. Remnants are drawn to power and information like organic animals to food; while tame remnants can gather theirs from connections to the Networks within cities, their wild counterparts must resort to other means. Remnants can produce energy through photosynthesis, kill other remnants for their power stores, or hunt people to siphon their energy. They act like other wild animals—always focused on their next meal, whatever they must do to get it. Rumors say that some wild remnants are able to harvest information from the brains of the creatures they kill.\n\nThe **Wastes** are the overgrown, hostile lands between cities that are filled with wild remnants and ancient ruins. The average citizen spends most of their life within a walled or wandering city, but needs arise that require trips out into the Wastes. City defenders must stop attacks from wild remnants, messengers run between cities when portions of the Network need repair, and some cities rely on hunting parties for food. Out in the Wastes, travelers and remnants alike can still access the Network through free data wells.\n\nTo access the vast information left behind by the ancient world, inhabitants both mortal and machine use the ports at the base of **data wells**, slender towers that reach up to the lines of the Network. Data wells can be found across the valley, but many exist within walled cities, rendering them inaccessible to the rest of the region. The wells in the Wastes that remain freely available become hotbeds of violence, as wild remnants use them like a watering hole for power and information. In contrast, the **Pilgrims of the Spire** are a group known to strongly value and protect free data wells, as they're considered sacred places connected to the Motherboard.\n\nThe tallest spire at the center of the Echo Vale is the **Motherboard**, from which all threads of the Network originate. Though no one has ever been able to enter this daunting tower, each city has their own beliefs about its ancient power. Most citizens revere the massive presence within as a god, believing it was worshipped by the fallen civilization and carries their wisdom forward to bless today's information-scarce world. Others believe it is a \"master program\" the technomancers of the fallen world left behind, and is therefore as fallible as any other remnant. Though the Motherboard herself does not communicate with people directly, she shepherds all data and power through the Network. Without her operating system, the valley's technology would eventually fail. Despite what is commonly believed, some technomancers and pilgrims claim to speak to the Motherboard in the machine language, known as \"kohd.\"\n\n**Technomancers** are the datacrafters who utilize ancient machines for new purposes. Historians work to decipher kohd, while practitioners work directly with remnants and other technology to gain a deeper understanding of this arcane language. Some forgo study of kohd entirely in favor of simply utilizing machines for their power. Most have a general understanding of how to employ the effects of the fallen world's technology, allowing them to operate and control its powerful programs, even without understanding its inner workings. Because this tech isn't fully understood by the people of the modern age, technomancers can manage only temporary repairs on the remnants.\n\n**Machinists** are more focused on the physical aspects of remnants. Many of them work in factories or scrap works, repairing gears, wires, and processors for a variety of machines, including remnants and mechanicals (operatordriven machines). Some machinists can cobble together new remnants from spare parts, but they must use old remnant cores from the fallen world to give them life. Stories tell of wild remnants creating more of their own kind, but most consider these myths told by travelers.\n\nRecently, a disaster occurred known as the **Remnant's Fury**—a virus spread through the Network that caused the remnants to attack in the dead of night. These machines, which once worked peacefully in homes and businesses, assailed hundreds of unsuspecting people in both walled and wandering cities. In the Wastes, travelers found themselves suddenly facing particularly violent packs of wild remnants. Autonomous machines have always posed unique dangers working remnants short out, wild remnants kill for energy but this was different. This was a massacre.\n\nMore and more remnants are becoming violent, and those who live under the Network must figure out what to do before the Echo Vale meets a fate like the fallen world. No one knows who or what caused the malicious virus taking hold of the remnants, but for it to be this widespread, there's growing certainty that it must somehow involve the Motherboard.\n\n![](_page_292_Picture_6.jpeg)",

  "context": "## 概览\n\n*如果您的团队决定进行此战役，请在创建角色前向您的玩家提供以下信息。*\n\n**回声谷**之所以得名，是因为这里的人们生活在一失落文明的遗迹——“回声”——之中，并试图将古老科技用于新的目的。自从失落文明神秘覆灭以来的数百年里，旧世界的钢铁和混凝土被山谷中的植物和动物所吞噬。古老道路的裂缝中长满了青草，废弃摩天大楼里树木安家，历史遗忘了 crumbling statues 中人物的名字，让那些在这些曾经伟大城市的躯壳中建造家园的人们，在遗留下来的强大程序和机器中摸索前行。\n\n如今，强大的定居点，如**阿金特**，在 decaying ruins 中安家，建造围墙以阻止暴力进入和工人外出。与此同时，**卡罗克罗夫特步行街**和其他 wandering cities 乘坐各种车辆穿梭于山谷之中，城镇如同背着背包的旅人，坐落在庞大的机器之上。\n\n山谷上方是**网络**，一张密集的闪烁金属丝网，在回声谷分散的城市之间传输信息和通信。尽管山谷居民长期以来一直使用这种古老科技，但用于创建和修改网络的复杂语言在先前文明覆灭时失传了。\n\n整个回声谷漫游着失落世界的自主机器，被称为**残余者**。这些自动机主要有两种形式。有些 resembling animals，其特征与活着的 counterparts 相符。另一些则设计时考虑到特定功能，例如防御者、建造者、守望者或 domestic laborers，它们与早已逝去的创造者一同执行任务。一些残余者生活在城市中，被认为是“驯服的”，而另一些则在 Wastes 中“野蛮”漫游，通常具有领地意识并 hunting for sources of energy。有些足够大，可以在背上承载整个 wandering cities，而另一些则是小型生物，除了为人们每天需要使用的 working machines 提供废料部件外，没有明显的功能。\n\n这些机器从多种来源获取能量。残余者像有机动物一样被力量和信息所吸引；驯服的残余者可以通过连接城市内的网络来获取能量，而它们的野蛮 counterparts 则必须诉诸其他手段。残余者可以通过光合作用产生能量，杀死其他残余者以获取它们的能量储备，或 hunting people to siphon their energy。它们像其他野生动物一样行动——总是专注于它们的下一餐，不惜一切代价。有传言说，一些野蛮残余者能够从它们杀死的生物的大脑中 harvest information。\n\n**Wastes**是城市之间杂草丛生、充满敌意的土地，那里充满了野蛮残余者和古老遗迹。普通市民大部分时间都生活在有围墙或 wandering city 中，但有时需要前往 Wastes。城市防御者必须阻止野蛮残余者的攻击，当部分网络需要维修时，信使在城市之间奔波，一些城市依赖狩猎队伍获取食物。在 Wastes 中，旅行者和残余者都可以通过 free data wells 访问网络。\n\n为了访问古老世界遗留下来的 vast information，无论是凡人还是机器的居民都使用**数据井**底部的端口，这些细长的塔楼向上延伸至网络的线路。数据井遍布整个山谷，但许多存在于 walled cities 中，使得该地区其他地方无法访问。Wastes 中仍然 freely available 的数据井成为暴力温床，因为野蛮残余者将它们用作获取力量和信息的 watering hole。相比之下，**尖塔朝圣者**是一个以高度重视和保护 free data wells 而闻名的小组，因为它们被认为是与 Motherboard 连接的 sacred places。\n\n回声谷中心最高的尖塔是**主板**，所有网络线程都源于此。尽管从未有人能够进入这座 daunting tower，但每个城市都有自己关于其古老力量的信仰。大多数市民将其中巨大的存在视为神，相信它曾被失落文明崇拜，并将他们的智慧传承至今，以祝福当今 information-scarce world。另一些人则认为它是失落世界 technomancers 留下的“主程序”，因此像其他任何残余者一样容易出错。尽管主板本身不直接与人交流，但它通过网络引导所有数据和力量。没有她的操作系统，山谷的科技最终会失效。尽管普遍认为如此，一些 technomancers 和朝圣者声称能够用机器语言与主板交流，这种语言被称为“kohd”。\n\n**技师**是利用古老机器实现新目的的 datacrafters。历史学家致力于 decipher kohd，而实践者则直接与残余者和其他科技合作，以深入了解这种 arcane language。有些人完全放弃研究 kohd，转而仅仅利用机器的力量。大多数人对如何运用失落世界科技的效果有 general understanding，使他们能够操作和控制其强大的程序，即使不了解其内部运作。由于现代人对这种科技并非完全理解，技师只能对残余者进行临时维修。\n\n**机械师**更关注残余者的物理方面。他们中的许多人在工厂或 scrap works 工作，维修各种机器的齿轮、电线和处理器，包括残余者和机械（操作员驱动的机器）。一些机械师可以用 spare parts 拼凑出新的残余者，但他们必须使用来自失落世界的旧残余者核心来赋予它们生命。有故事讲述野蛮残余者创造更多同类，但大多数人认为这些是旅行者讲述的神话。\n\n最近，发生了一场被称为**残余者之怒**的灾难——一种病毒通过网络传播，导致残余者在夜深人静时发动攻击。这些机器曾经在家庭和企业中 peaceful working，袭击了数百名 unsuspecting people，无论是在 walled cities 还是 wandering cities。在 Wastes 中，旅行者突然 facing 特别 violent packs of wild remnants。自主机器一直带来独特的危险， working remnants short out， wild remnants kill for energy 但这次不同。这是一场屠杀。\n\n越来越多的残余者变得 violent，而那些生活在网络之下的人们必须在回声谷遭遇像失落世界一样的命运之前想办法。没有人知道是什么或谁导致了这种恶意病毒 control 残余者，但如此 widespread，越来越确定它一定与主板有关。\n\n![](_page_292_Picture_6.jpeg)"

But wave after wave succumbed to the malicious virus, and politicians grew more desperate to avoid widespread fear.\n\n**Priv Maelor Rhodek** (orderborne elf, she/her), the city's charismatic leader, sent a messenger to assemble a team that has the skill and experience to handle remnants, go undercover as civilians in the machinists' Build Sector, and figure out what's causing the remnant attacks.\n\nPriv Rhodek gives her word that any scrap the party acquires while protecting the city is theirs to keep. In return, she asks that they collect as many remnant cores as possible so she can pass them to her technomancers to diagnose the cause of the violence. She also gives the party the name of a surprising contact to see before they head into the scrap factory where many attacks have occurred.\n\nThe contact is **Mac the Scrap Jack** (wanderborne faun, he/him), who runs an illegal scrap operation, making him an unlikely friend for the very person that outlaws his work. But on the Priv's word, he gives the party a Hotspot. This illegal device can be carried as a backpack and, when set down and activated, it stalls out nearby remnants for a few moments, allowing the party to get out of a bind.\n\nHe also gives the party an offer: save one of the remnant cores they recover and bring it to him instead of Rhodek. He'll pay them a few quantum, and they'll have the opportunity to look at the data from the core to try and see what's \"causing all this ruckus with the rems.\"\n\nAs they fight their way through the factory, does the party have compassion for the once-tame remnants, or do they dispose of them indiscriminately? Will the players try to talk to the factory workers to learn more about the Remnant's Fury, or will they operate like a cleanup crew, keep their eye on the scrap they stand to gain? Will they bring the Priv all the remnant cores they collect, or will they save one for Mac and risk trouble from the city guard? If they perform well, will Priv Rhodek tell the party more about the Remnant's Fury and the involvement of the Motherboard?",

  "original": "## OVERVIEW\n\n*If your group decides to play this campaign, give your players the following information before character creation.*\n\nThe **Prophecy of the Drylands God** begins as thus: In the center of the world there is a mountain, and deep beneath that mountain there is an ancient and terrible god—a Forgotten God—struggling to break free of his confinement. One day Kudamat, the First Doom will escape his earthen tomb with the help of his nine colossi, the Children of Godfell, to sunder the world, his hated prison, and tear down the sky like fabric. As the New Gods fall from the Hallows Above, Kudamat will slay them with his stone sickle that their blood will flood the Mortal Realm. In this sanguine tide, Kudamat and the new generation of colossi, each made from the god's very being, will destroy the creatures of the Mortal Realm and make room for abhorrent creations to repopulate the land, sea, and sky. In his triumph, Kudamat will free the many trapped gods of his generation and become the high lord among all divinities.\n\nAt least, that's how the old story went. Most people believed it was just another tall tale of the Drylands.\n\nThe **History of the Gods** is a myth known by many and believed by few: When the Forgotten Gods built the Mortal Realm in the Earliest Age, they made a place of joys and sorrows, freedom and labor. All the creatures of the land, sea, and sky worked for the many gods and enjoyed the spoils and trials of deities that had nothing but time and endless curiosity. These immortals could not fathom that the New Gods would one day rise and overthrow them in a violent battle, tossing them from their place in the high Hallows Above and entrapping them in the Mortal Realm and the Circles Below.\n\nMany Forgotten Gods imprisoned in the Mortal Realm were trapped within the ground, buried over the centuries beneath the rise and fall of civilizations. The deific essence of these gods bleeds from their lasting wounds—and whether this enervation was intentional or not, their power seeped into the earth where they're entombed, running like veins of stone up to the surface. The crystal born from these veins is known as \"essentia,\" and all magic in the Mortal Realm comes from its power. As such, there's a mad scramble for any opportunity to harvest this precious resource, and in the eyes of those in power, land with a vein of essentia is worth the millions of lives sacrificed to the mines built to dig the crystals up.\n\n**Godfell Mountain** is one such land. Sitting in the middle of a crowd of high mesas, amid arid countryside peppered by meager lakes and sparse forests, this peak marks the richest essentia mines on the continent. Though it's not the center of the world as the stories say, it's the hub of a region filled with newfound wealth, industry, and an ever-expanding network of dusty towns run by crooked sheriffs.\n\nThe numerous veins of essentia running from Godfell Mountain come from the power of **Kudamat, the First Doom**, a Forgotten God seeking freedom and the destruction of the entire Mortal Realm. As these makeshift towns follow the veins of crystal ever closer to Godfell, they move toward the\n\nblighted earth the New Gods left to keep mortals from the prison of the ancient god. This mountain is a desolate and dangerous place where few can survive, but that doesn't stop powerful mining operations and bold prospectors from trying their luck.\n\nKudamat was trapped within Godfell Mountain, or rather, the mountain was formed around him when the Forgotten Gods lost to the New Gods at the end of the Earliest Age. Ever since, like many of his kind, Kudamat was forced to wait for the day he could finally break free. But it wasn't a simple burial the New Gods performed. To trap the First Doom, the usurper gods split part of his being into nine pieces and tasked nine mortals with hiding the soul shards so Kudamat could not reach his full power.\n\nBut they should not have given such a paramount task to mere mortals. The nine riders took the shards as far from the mountain as they could manage and buried them in the arid earth, but it wasn't far enough. Over the centuries, Kudamat reached out through the dirt and stone, veins of crystalline essentia stretching out like tendrils to find his missing pieces. Over time, the godly strife of the Earliest Age and the hidden resting places of the soul shards drifted out of memory and into stories and legends. Legends most sensible folk ignored or forgot.\n\nWhen Kudamat found the first piece of his soul, he began channeling its power to restore his godhood, and a single thundering quake tore a fissure through the center street of Wyllin's Gulch—a terrible earthquake, they believed, not understanding the apocalyptic toll ringing out across the sands. Kudamat then used a fragment of his divine might to craft a colossus and droves of accompanying aberrations that would guard the soul shard while he siphons the remainder of his power and seeks out the other eight shards. Even with only the barest portion of his power restored, Kudamat's reawakening is all but inevitable. He grows stronger by the day, searching out the remaining pieces and building more colossi to guard them. If left unchecked, he will reclaim the power of all nine shards and break his earthen shackles, rising again to bring doom to this world.\n\n**Preacher Rayos** (he/him) was the first, or perhaps only the loudest, to recognize the rise of the colossus outside **Wyllin's Gulch** as the first step in the Prophecy of the Drylands God. He proclaimed the story of Kudamat, warning people of the increased dangers of the god's charged essentia. Above all else, he stressed the importance of finding the soul shards and keeping the god from siphoning them. To get the word out, he took his flock from their home in the Left Luck Outpost to Wyllin's Gulch, the unofficial capital of the western line, where he continues to preach, growing more popular with each passing day. He already had enough of a following in his community—and now times are apocalyptic enough that people are eager for a spiritual leader.\n\nWyllin's Gulch worships no gods but the earning and spending of gold, and it will take more than a violent colossus to get the people of this town to pay attention to an ancient prophecy. In the early days of the Essentia Rush, roughly 40 years ago, the Gulch was established as the first western outpost in the region surrounding Godfell Mountain, just a few miles from a rich vein of essentia. As more and more of the crystals were unearthed, powerful moguls established processing plants to speed up the time between mine and money. Belching factories were built up the sides of the Twin Turtles, two great mesas that bordered the burgeoning town, their massive conveyor lifts hauling tons of essentia to the manufactories that process the crystals into the conductive batteries most folk use to power their homes, weapons, and all manner of magical items.\n\nToday, with its natural fortifications and wealthy elite, Wyllin's Gulch is the gatekeeper for anyone approaching Godfell Mountain on the western train line. As such, the townspeople either work mining and processing essentia or host money traps that appeal to new fools who come to try their hand at prospecting the crystals.\n\nA wide variety of folks inhabit Wyllin's Gulch. The arid plains, breathtaking skies, and the possibility of boundless riches attract all types. Living away from the prying eye of larger law enforcement is another perk—while there are sheriffs in Wyllin's Gulch, they're paid to protect the mines and manufacturing rather than uphold any version of \"justice.\" It's common for outlaw gangs to seek their fortunes by stealing the valuable crystals, while others, who see these mining operations as anathema, destroy the equipment that tears essentia from the ground. But most outlaws find greater success at the smaller essentia outposts than this bastion of dusty fortitude.\n\n**Essentia outposts** range in size from a small collection of tents to a thriving town. Some outposts are formed when just a few folks get together to mine the same vein or sift the same river. Others are created when a company purchases a parcel of land containing a vein and installs a small settlement of workers. Still others are larger towns built by people wanting a bit of community along with their work. Though essentia outposts can vary in size, style, and operating procedure, one thing is always true: where there is an outpost around Godfell Mountain, there's a vein of essentia. Now, these outposts face the coming threat of more colossi rising from the earth as Kudamat locates his soul shards and uses the essentia veins to siphon back his power.",

  "context": "## 概述\n\n*如果您的团队决定进行此战役，请在角色创建前向您的玩家提供以下信息。*\n\n**旱地之神的预言**始于此：世界中心有一座山，山深处有一个古老而可怕的神——一个被遗忘的神——正在挣扎着挣脱束缚。终有一天，库达马特，第一末日，将在他的九个巨像，戈德费尔之子的帮助下，挣脱他的泥土坟墓，撕裂世界，他憎恨的牢狱，像撕裂布料一样撕下天空。当新神从上界圣所坠落时，库达马特将用他的石镰刀杀死他们，他们的血液将淹没凡人领域。在这血色潮汐中，库达马特和新一代巨像，每个都由神自身的本体构成，将摧毁凡人领域的生物，为可憎造物腾出空间，重新填充陆地、海洋和天空。在他的胜利中，库达马特将解放他那一代许多被困的神，并成为所有神祇中的至高主宰。\n\n至少，古老的故事是这么说的。大多数人认为这只是旱地又一个夸大的传说。\n\n**诸神历史**是一个许多人知晓但很少有人相信的神话：当被遗忘的神在最早时代建造凡人领域时，他们创造了一个充满欢乐与悲伤、自由与劳作的地方。陆地、海洋和天空的所有生物都为众多神祇工作，享受着那些只有时间和无尽好奇心的神祇带来的战利品和考验。这些不朽者无法想象，新神有一天会崛起，在一场暴力战斗中推翻他们，将他们从上界圣所的高位抛下，并将他们困在凡人领域和下界循环中。\n\n许多被困在凡人领域的被遗忘的神都被困在地下，在几个世纪以来文明的兴衰中被埋葬。这些神的本体神力从他们持续的伤口中流出——无论这种衰弱是有意还是无意，他们的力量渗入他们被埋葬的土地，像石脉一样向上延伸到地面。从这些脉中诞生的水晶被称为“精华”，凡人领域的所有魔法都来自它的力量。因此，人们疯狂地争夺任何收获这种珍贵资源的机会，而在当权者眼中，拥有精华矿脉的土地价值数百万生命被牺牲给为挖掘水晶而建造的矿井。\n\n**戈德费尔山**就是这样一片土地。坐落在一群高高的平顶山中间，在一片贫瘠的乡村中，点缀着稀疏的湖泊和森林，这座山峰标志着这片大陆上最富饶的精华矿井。虽然它不像故事中所说的那样是世界的中心，但它是这个区域的中心，充满了新发现的财富、工业，以及一个不断扩张的由腐败警长管理的尘土飞扬的小镇网络。\n\n从戈德费尔山延伸出来的众多精华矿脉来自寻求自由和摧毁整个凡人领域的被遗忘的神——**库达马特，第一末日**的力量。随着这些临时搭建的小镇沿着水晶矿脉越来越靠近戈德费尔，它们正朝着\n\n新神留下的被诅咒的土地前进，以阻止凡人进入古神的监狱。这座山是一片荒凉危险的地方，很少有人能生存下来，但这并不能阻止强大的采矿公司和大胆的勘探者碰运气。\n\n库达马特被困在戈德费尔山中，或者说，当被遗忘的神在最早时代末期输给新神时，这座山围绕着他形成。从那时起，像他许多同类一样，库达马特被迫等待他最终能够挣脱束缚的那一天。但这并非新神进行的简单埋葬。为了困住第一末日，篡位者神将他的一部分本体分裂成九块，并委托九个凡人隐藏这些灵魂碎片，以便库达马特无法达到他的全部力量。\n\n但他们不应该将如此重要的任务交给凡人。九名骑手将碎片带到离山尽可能远的地方，并将它们埋在贫瘠的土地里，但这还不够远。几个世纪以来，库达马特通过泥土和石头伸出触角，水晶精华的脉络像卷须一样延伸出去寻找他失踪的碎片。随着时间的推移，最早时代的神祇纷争和灵魂碎片的隐藏安息之地逐渐从记忆中淡出，融入故事和传说。大多数理智的人都忽略或遗忘了这些传说。\n\n当库达马特找到他灵魂的第一块碎片时，他开始引导它的力量来恢复他的神性，一场惊天动地的地震撕裂了威林峡谷中心街道的一条裂缝——一场可怕的地震，他们相信，不明白这场响彻沙漠的末日钟声。库达马特随后利用他神圣力量的一小部分制造了一个巨像和成群的随行畸形生物来守护灵魂碎片，同时他汲取剩余的力量并寻找其他八块碎片。即使只有他最微弱的力量恢复，库达马特的觉醒也几乎是不可避免的。他一天天变得更强，寻找剩余的碎片并建造更多的巨像来守护它们。如果放任不管，他将夺回所有九块碎片的力量，挣脱他的泥土枷锁，再次崛起，为这个世界带来毁灭。\n\n**传教士雷奥斯**（他/他）是第一个，或许只是最响亮的，将威林峡谷外的巨像崛起视为旱地之神预言的第一步。他宣扬库达马特的故事，警告人们神祇充能精华带来的日益增加的危险。最重要的是，他强调寻找灵魂碎片并阻止神祇汲取它们的重要性。为了传播信息，他将他的信徒从他们位于左运气前哨的家带到威林峡谷，那里是西部线的非官方首都，他在那里继续传教，每天都变得更受欢迎。他在自己的社区已经有了足够的追随者——现在时代已经足够末日，人们渴望一位精神领袖。\n\n威林峡谷不崇拜任何神，只崇拜金钱的赚取和花费，要让这个小镇的人们关注一个古老的预言，需要的不仅仅是一个暴力的巨像。在大约40年前的精华热潮初期，峡谷被建立为戈德费尔山周边地区的第一个西部前哨，距离一条富饶的精华矿脉仅几英里。随着越来越多的水晶被挖出，强大的巨头建立了加工厂，以加快矿井到金钱之间的时间。在双龟（两个与新兴小镇接壤的巨大平顶山）两侧建造了冒着黑烟的工厂，它们巨大的传送带将数吨精华运往加工厂，这些加工厂将水晶加工成大多数人用来为他们的家、武器和各种魔法物品提供动力的导电电池。\n\n如今，凭借其天然的防御工事和富裕的精英，威林峡谷是任何从西部火车线路接近戈德费尔山的人的守门人。因此，镇上的人们要么从事采矿和加工精华的工作，要么经营吸引新来的傻瓜尝试勘探水晶的赚钱陷阱。\n\n威林峡谷居住着各种各样的人。干旱的平原、令人惊叹的天空以及无限财富的可能性吸引着各种类型的人。远离大型执法机构的窥探是另一个好处——虽然威林峡谷有警长，但他们是受雇保护矿井和制造业，而不是维护任何形式的“正义”。非法帮派通过偷窃珍贵的水晶来寻求财富是很常见的，而另一些人则将这些采矿活动视为诅咒，摧毁那些从地面挖出精华的设备。但大多数不法之徒在较小的精华前哨比在这个尘土飞扬的堡垒更容易成功。\n\n**精华前哨**的规模从一小群帐篷到繁荣的小镇不等。一些前哨是由几个人聚集在一起开采同一条矿脉或淘洗同一条河流而形成的。另一些则是由公司购买包含矿脉的土地并建立一个小型的工人定居点而创建的。还有一些是由希望在工作之余拥有一些社区感的人们建造的较大城镇。尽管精华前哨的规模、风格和运营方式各不相同，但有一点始终不变：在戈德费尔山周围有前哨的地方，就有精华矿脉。现在，随着库达马特找到他的灵魂碎片并利用精华矿脉汲取回他的力量，这些前哨面临着更多巨像从地下崛起的威胁。"

  "original": "## **Drylands Outposts**\n\nSince the Essentia Rush began about 40 years ago, settlements like Wyllin's Gulch formed around Godfell Mountain. Some are small encampments, while others are bustling towns cut through by dirt streets. But no matter their size, they're always referred to as outposts, because everyone knows that once the local essentia veins are cleaned out, people will have their town packed up overnight.\n\nBelow are a few of the larger outposts, but you're encouraged to make your own:\n\n**The Cinderline:** Named for the unique black sand the town is built upon, the Cinderline sprung up around a river that washed bits of essentia into a nice deposit downstream, though no one has successfully panned for essentia in the last few years. Locals are fiercely protective of their water supply, as this outpost is the last stop for fresh water before a long stretch of desert.\n\n**Havalaugh:** The name sounds as cordial as the folks in this encampment. Though there isn't a permanent building in sight, the tents that form this town stretch for at least a mile. Run by someone known only as **Pickens** (they/them), Havalaugh is fairly receptive to outsiders. The outpost is considered to host the premier marketplace on the eastern side of the mountain, and its High Summer Festival is famous—enough for Havalaugh to nearly quintuple its size for a week. There's no sheriff in Havalaugh, but anyone who harms a citizen is never heard from again.\n\n**The Iron Kettle:** One of the more industrialized outposts in the region, the Iron Kettle is built around a massive mine owned by Iron Tusk Corp. Because of the talent needed to construct the mining infrastructure, it's a rustic place full of skilled smiths and crafters, many of whom sell goods to travelers outside their work for Iron Tusk. This need for steel goods has given the smiths more power than Iron Tusk would prefer. But a powerful trade union formed by the smiths keeps them in check and governs \"The Kettle,\" taking the onus (and liability) off the company.\n\n**Pryor:** Built into a long-abandoned essentia mine, Pryor is often unnoticed by those who don't know where to look as they ride by. The folk that live in this insular outpost are not known to welcome guests, but if you have a contact who can get you in their good graces, you're likely to learn the best tricks of the Drylands from the citizens of Pryor. Most of these families stretch back to the time before the Essentia Rush, when there were only a few folk mining these lands.\n\n**Defiance:** Famous for its position high atop a mesa, Defiance is an outpost rumored to have been established by a band of thieves looking to escape the law—and its position certainly provides a good view of anyone coming their way. These vagrants have a considerable cache of artillery aimed at the ground below, and they aren't known to fire warning shots.",

  "context": "## **旱地前哨**\n\n自大约40年前精华素淘金热开始以来，像怀林峡谷这样的定居点围绕着神陨山形成。有些是小型营地，有些则是被土路穿过的繁华城镇。但无论规模大小，它们总是被称为前哨，因为每个人都知道，一旦当地的精华素矿脉被清理干净，人们就会在一夜之间打包离开他们的城镇。\n\n以下是一些较大的前哨，但我们鼓励你创造自己的：\n\n**煤渣线（The Cinderline）：** 因城镇建于独特的黑沙之上而得名，煤渣线围绕着一条河流而兴起，这条河流将精华素冲刷到下游形成了不错的沉积物，尽管过去几年没有人成功淘到精华素。当地人对他们的水源极力保护，因为这个前哨是进入漫长沙漠之前的最后一站淡水补给点。\n\n**哈瓦劳（Havalaugh）：** 这个名字听起来就像这个营地的人们一样热情友好。虽然看不到永久性建筑，但形成这个城镇的帐篷绵延至少一英里。由一个只被称作 **皮肯斯** (他们/她们) 的人管理，哈瓦劳对外来者相当开放。这个前哨被认为是山脉东侧首屈一指的集市所在地，其仲夏节（High Summer Festival）非常有名——足以让哈瓦劳在一周内规模扩大近五倍。哈瓦劳没有治安官，但任何伤害市民的人都会从此人间蒸发。\n\n**铁锅（The Iron Kettle）：** 该地区工业化程度较高的前哨之一，铁锅围绕着由铁牙公司（Iron Tusk Corp.）拥有的一座大型矿井而建。由于建造采矿基础设施所需的技艺，这是一个质朴的地方，聚集了许多技艺精湛的铁匠和工匠，其中许多人在为铁牙公司工作之余向旅行者出售商品。对钢铁商品的需求使得这些铁匠比铁牙公司更具影响力。但由铁匠组成的强大工会控制着他们并管理着“锅”，减轻了公司的负担（和责任）。\n\n**普莱尔（Pryor）：** 建在一个早已废弃的精华素矿井中，普莱尔经常被那些骑马路过却不知道往哪看的人忽略。居住在这个封闭前哨的人们以不欢迎客人而闻名，但如果你有能让你获得他们好感的联系人，你很可能会从普莱尔的市民那里学到旱地最好的技巧。这些家庭中的大多数都可以追溯到精华素淘金热之前，那时只有少数人在这些土地上采矿。\n\n**反抗（Defiance）：** 因其位于高耸的平顶山顶而闻名，反抗是一个据说由一群寻求逃避法律的盗贼建立的前哨——其位置无疑提供了对任何来犯者的良好视野。这些流浪者拥有相当数量瞄准下方地面的火炮，并且他们不以鸣枪示警而闻名。"

  "original": "## THE INCITING INCIDENT\n\n*You can use the prompt below to start your campaign, or create your own.*\n\nWhen the first colossus rose outside Wyllin's Gulch, most people spent a considerable amount of time panicking. The sheriff raised a small army to fight it, a band of brave miners piled old equipment in its path, and the factories shuttered to protect their stores of essentia. But every effort was ineffective in stopping the massive creature's path of destruction\n\nAfter seeing most of his deputies die in a single crushing blow, **Mayor Logan Hartly** (she/her) put out an ad. \"Help Wanted. Whoever can dispatch the colossus and its pack of abberations will receive a chest of fully processed essentia.\" It's a good deal for anyone who can manage to fight the gigantic force of nature and live to tell the tale.\n\nMeanwhile, **Baron Ryder Destry** (he/him)—his name, not a title—recently learned that Kudamat's efforts to siphon the power of his soul has supercharged the veins of essentia connected to the shard, making the stones ten times as valuable. He's offering \"an army's supply of powerful essentia\" to anyone who will collaborate with the colossus to stand guard around the soul shard until Kudamat completes his ritual. Destry swears his factory guard can keep Wyllin's Gulch safe, and he'll keep his teams mining the powerful essentia night and day.\n\nThe party was assembled by the mayor's \"Help Wanted\" ad, but Destry's offer put more than a few wrenches in an already near-impossible plan. Numerous groups with their eye on Destry's prize are already on their way to the colossus to help it guard Kudamat's soul shard. In addition, smaller aberrations have begun to rise from the veins of essentia to aid their titanic counterpart. If the party can manage to fight their way through these smaller adversaries, they'll have to topple a colossus, a feat no one in the Drylands has ever accomplished.\n\nWill the party take the offer from the mayor, or give up the effort to stand alongside the colossus while Destry continues to mine the supercharged essentia? Can they play both sides? Will Hartly keep her word if they manage to topple the colossus? Can the party kill the massive creation before it destroys Wyllin's Gulch, or any of the smaller outposts nearby? Once they've destroyed this colossus, are the stories true, with another rise to fulfill the Prophecy of the Drylands?",

For example, you might decide you want to build out Ikeri, Injuries Untold. You could divide their segments into six stat blocks: two legs, two arms, a torso, and a head. Additionally, these segment stat blocks exist within the **colossus framework**, a stat block that holds the information and features that apply to the colossus as a whole.\n\nSome segments can be *Broken.* While *Broken*, the segment can't use actions or reactions until the condition is cleared. When a segment marks its last Hit Point, it's considered *Destroyed*. A *Destroyed* segment can no longer use any of its features. A colossus is defeated when all their segments are *Destroyed*, but colossi often have an alternative way to be defeated, as well. When a segment is *Destroyed*, that doesn't mean it's gone or detached—it simply doesn't work anymore.\n\nYou can use the following Tier 1 stat block as your party's first colossus encounter, and it also serves as a template you can use to make your own colossi. The sections after the Tier 1 colossus stat blocks provide additional feature examples, guidance for running colossi, and more example stat blocks at higher tiers.",

  "original": "#### USING A COLOSSUS IN BATTLE\n\nOn your GM turn, treat each segment of a colossus as its own adversary when moving the spotlight. You can spotlight a segment as your GM move, then spend a Fear to spotlight an additional segment as you would during a fight with regular adversaries. Some colossi also have actions in their colossus framework; you can spotlight the framework to use this action as you would spotlight a segment, but you should highlight the colossus as a whole in the narrative. You can still spotlight additional segments on your turn.\n\nWhile a PC is on a segment of the colossus:\n\n- They have advantage on attacks against that segment.\n- The segment's standard attack cannot be used on that PC.\n\nFor example, they can't grab a PC who's riding on their hand! The colossus would need to use a different segment to attack them. Any feature that allows a segment to attack a PC who's currently on that segment will call it out in its description. For example, the \"Shake Off\" feature specifies \"all creatures on the colossus,\" meaning it would include creatures on that segment.\n\nAny features that would pull or push normal adversaries can't move a colossus; instead, the feature pulls or pushes the PC making the attack. For example, using a grappler against a colossus can't pull them toward you, but instead pulls you toward them. Any time an effect is targeting the colossus, use the Difficulty of the segment being targeted. If an effect targets a colossus as a collective, use the highest Difficulty amongst all the segments. If a PC's feature targets multiple adversaries, it can target multiple segments.\n\nTypically when fighting a colossus, there is no need to add additional adversaries to the encounter—colossi are powerful enough on their own! If you do want to have other adversaries involved, think about their relationship with the colossus. Are they an aberration? Do they find the colossus useful for their own purposes? We recommend keeping additional adversaries limited and purposeful, or a fight can become unwieldy.\n\nLastly, give the characters information about how to take down a colossus, and consider how that information can be creatively delivered. Part of the hunt phase should include the PCs tracking down knowledge about the colossus before facing it; you're encouraged to seed rumors from townspeople about what they've seen, then provide payoff when some of those rumors are proven true during the fight. Additionally, examine the colossus's stat block and plan ways you might give clues about its physical body using color, light, and shape to telegraph important information. If you describe heavy armor that surrounds a delicate blue light pulsing in the core of the chest, they'll have a pretty good idea where the weak point is and the armor they need to contend with. Think about how you can use all of a character's senses to convey the mechanics of the colossus and use them to narratively guide your players along the monstrous beast. For example, this segment's skin feels squishier than the other parts of this creature they've been on, or the smell is getting more putrid the higher they climb, or they can hear a shrill cry getting louder as they move toward the tail.",

  "original": "## SESSION ZERO QUESTIONS\n\n*Ask any of these questions to your players, or make your own.*\n\n- Is your character native to the Drylands, or did they come from elsewhere? How have they been treated by the locals and incoming prospectors?\n- What is your character's favorite thing about the geography of the Drylands? Do they have a notable landmark they're drawn to?\n- Since the rise of the colossi, who or what has your character lost, and how did that event change them?\n- Some believe that, despite the prophecy, Kudamat will bring prosperity to mortals when he rises. Does your character believe this? How do they interact with the people who do?\n- Describe an outpost your character visited in the past. What did they love about it? What worried them?\n- What terrors has your character seen roaming the desert now that Kudamat is raising ever more aberrations?\n- What themes are you most interested in exploring with your characters, and how might they manifest in some of the colossi?",
