You are the massive sandstorm that hinders their journey, the innkeeper they befriend while seeking shelter, the mysterious stranger in the corner who asks them for help, or anything else that comes up during a session. Being a GM can be one of the most fun, exhilarating, and fulfilling experiences at the table—but it can also be intimidating, especially when you're learning a new system.\n\nParts of this chapter are much more conversational than the rest of the book. The previous chapters were primarily focused on delivering the mechanics of the game; while we're going to cover mechanics in this chapter as well, we're also going to talk about topics that lend themselves much better to a conversation than hard-and-fast rules: aspects of gameplay like story structure, improv, and world-building. Because, at the end of the day, the \"big secret\" about GMing is that you aren't bound by a rigid ruleset like the players—you get to make it all up. Whether you made it up the week before, the day before, or in the moment at the table, you're always crafting an experience for your players through the decisions you make.\n\nThis chapter is dedicated to giving you the tools you need to run a game of Daggerheart: understanding the core mechanics; creating memorable encounters; planning exciting sessions; knowing how to select, create, and use GM moves; crafting a full campaign; running dynamic NPCs; and more.",

  "original": "## GM PRINCIPLES\n\nDaggerheart stands on the shoulders of a decades-long tradition of fantasy adventure TTRPGs that traces back to the beginning of the form as we know it. This game shares many characteristics with its predecessors—an attention to dramatized combat, familiar fantasy ancestries and archetypes, common touchstones from popular culture and folklore, and more. In addition, as you can see in the \"Touchstones\" section in the Introduction, Daggerheart draws inspiration from a variety of TTRPGs and other media beyond the fantasy adventure genre.\n\nDaggerheart prioritizes and provides the tools for telling a certain kind of heroic fantasy story. The system is focused on building collaborative, character-focused stories full of emotion, and it weaves the narrative through the entire experience, including its combat. Battle comes alive when the dramatic beats and rhythm highlight the conflicting motivations of combatants, when the characters' bonds impact their decisions in the fight, and when there is a goal beyond simply killing every combatant. Daggerheart truly shines when the battles against adversaries are a dramatic beat in a larger, emotionally grounded story about the wants and needs of the characters.\n\n**Following these GM principles will help the whole table have the best possible experience playing this game:**\n\n- → Begin and end with the fiction.\n- → Collaborate at all times, especially during conflict.\n- → Fill the world with life, wonder, and danger.\n- → Ask questions and incorporate the answers.\n- → Make every roll important.\n- → Play to find out what happens.\n- → Hold on gently.",

Use the fiction to drive mechanics—for example, when to call for rolls, which GM moves to use, what Difficulty a roll should be, or whether it should have advantage or disadvantage. Daggerheart's rules exist to facilitate collaborative storytelling, so the flow of play should begin with narrative and lead to mechanics when needed. The GM then connects the results of the mechanics back to the fiction so play can continue smoothly.",

Antagonism between player and GM should exist only in the fiction of the game, through the actions of NPCs and opposition within the narrative.\n\nNeither the PCs nor the players are your \"enemy.\" They're the opponents of the adversaries you play, but you and the players are on the same side: the side invested in telling an amazing story together. When representing antagonists and challenges, your main job is to balance presenting credible threats with maintaining the trust of the players so that the collaborative process can succeed.\n\nPart of collaboration is being a fan of the players and a fan of their characters. Being a fan of the players means consciously including story elements and themes they've expressed interest in. It also means giving them the benefit of the doubt when they forget something small—especially something that their character wouldn't forget. Being a fan of the PCs means that while you'll make their life challenging, up to and potentially including death, you're never rooting for them to lose—you're working with the players to ensure that the characters' story is exciting and the environment around them is behaving with internal consistency.",

When resolving an action, deliver on the expectations you set when you called for the roll. If you tell the PC that a successful Agility Roll will let them jump from their airship to another, when they succeed, let them do it.\n\nThis also means admitting when you misstep or misspeak, and checking in with your players when you're unsure what they intend.

An ambitious baroness wants to gain status and increase her sphere of influence, so she acts to extend her power. A large swamp serpent is motivated by hunger and safety, so they hunt outsiders, but they might not chase them beyond the muddy water if they're sated.\n\nEach adversary stat block suggests a couple general motives, but when you're depicting important NPCs, consider both their short-term and long-term goals. A renowned thief might be most immediately driven by a desire to steal crown jewels from a caravan, but their ultimate goal is to avoid capture by the king's guard—when both of these motivations impact their decisions, this creates a multidimensional character.\n\nThe players might not always know a character's true motives, but if you keep motivation in mind, you can depict the world with depth and consistency. When you hint at or reveal an NPC's motives, the players can push and pull on the NPC's hopes and fears to create dynamic bonds.\n\nAction without motivation can feel like choreography.

Everyone's minds work in different ways, and a puzzle or riddle with only one \"right\" answer can shut down interesting alternatives. If the players get bogged down or frustrated with a puzzle or scene, consider finding a way to move things along or adjust the situation to let the character's actions advance the story.

Use this guide to determine what to present the player, choosing whichever option best fits the situation:\n\n- **Let the PC guarantee success in exchange for a consequence.** If there is an opportunity for an interesting consequence, offer the player that outcome in exchange for performing the move without a roll; should they agree, the PC succeeds and you narrate the repercussions. For example, rather than rolling to see if a PC can jump from one roof to another, you might allow them to automatically succeed in exchange for being noticed by bystanders on the street beneath them.\n- **Establish the stakes.** If a move is particularly difficult or dangerous and offers interesting consequences for success or failure, establish the stakes for the roll so that the player knows what to expect. Once everyone is aligned, ask the player to roll and shape the fiction around the results. For example, you can inform a player whose wants their PC to leap across rooftops that they'll jump without alerting anyone on a success, but a failure will mean they crash into the streets below, suffering heavy injuries. This empowers the player to take informed risks and lean into the fiction.\n- **Make clear any guaranteed consequences.** If a move is particularly difficult or dangerous, and if it will certainly have repercussions regardless of whether the PC succeeds or not, tell the player about those repercussions before the move occurs. If the player wishes to proceed with the move, ask them to roll and narrate the consequences without compromising on your repercussions. For example, you might tell a player who wants their PC to jump from the roof of a burning building to safety that the roof will collapse in the attempt.

Unlike the PCs, you aren't bound by specific spells you can cast or certain effects you can do—when you make GM moves, you are acting to shape and facilitate the story, whatever that requires. When you begin a GM move, you are starting your **GM turn**. When you are done making your GM move (or moves) and play passes back to the PCs, your GM turn is over.\n\nAt its most simple, a GM move is anything you do that guides the story. These moves can heighten the danger, often by introducing conflict or increasing the Difficulty, or they can offer ease and support, often by revealing new information or relieving a burden. This ebb and flow of opposition and cooperation facilitates dynamic play and invites opportunities for both GMs and players to surprise one another with exciting choices.\n\nIf moves are your chance to make things happen in the scene, what should you do? The upcoming sections provide suggestions (and examples in the \"Example GM Moves\" section), but these decisions are hard to make in a vacuum. The best tool you have at your disposal is listening to your players as they add to the narrative, then weaving your moves into theirs.",

The frequency and severity of these moves depends on the type of story you're telling, the actions your players take, and the tone of the session you're running, but the general rule of thumb is this: you can make a GM move whenever you want. That's right! You're the GM—your job is not to crush the PCs or always act adversarially; it's to help tell a story. You should be making moves whenever you see an opportunity to do so.\n\nConsider making a GM move when a player does one of the following things:\n\n- Rolls with Fear on an action roll.\n- Fails an action roll.\n- Does something that would have consequences.\n- Gives you a golden opportunity.\n- Looks to you for what happens next.\n\nNote that making a big move isn't always necessary! When you can't see an opening for a narratively impactful move, remember the other tools in your toolkit: make a PC mark a Stress, progress an event happening outside the current scene, or even defer the consequence for later. For example, perhaps nothing happens when you break the cursed object now, but its rightful owner might come to collect their due down the line.",

For example, if the PCs are hiding from a group of thieves while discussing the bandit leader's plans, a PC might say with dramatic irony, \"But surely they won't look in the eaves of every barn in the district!\" In response, you might describe the barn door noisily swinging open as a bandit steps inside, a lit torch in one hand and a sword in the other as they peer into the rafters where the characters are hiding.",

  "original": "## **AVOID UNDERMINING SUCCESS**\n\nOn a success with Fear, one pitfall GMs can run into is undermining their players' success when making a GM move as the consequence. For example, if a PC makes a Finesse roll in an attempt to move stealthily through a hallway, and they succeed but roll with Fear, don't use your move to sound an alarm bell or make someone bump into them, spoiling their cover. The PC succeeded on the roll, and that success should be honored, even if it comes with a consequence. Instead, consider options such as introducing a new obstacle at their target destination or adding a new enemy approaching from behind to complicate their situation.\n\nSimilarly, if a PC does something cool—such as cleverly casting a spell—let them enjoy it instead of immediately foiling their schemes and let the scene play out for a while, using moves to change and escalate the scenario rather than end the effect. For example, a PC might circumvent a trap you laid; rather than immediately use a GM move to spring the trap into working, let the PC feel smart as you instead use your next GM move to summon more foes or telegraph what other dangers might be on the path ahead. Use your GM moves to immediately shut down an effect when it involves a climactic moment or a powerful adversary—when you need to show that the situation is dire.\n\nKeep this principle in mind as you make GM moves. The following sections provide advice on what kind of moves you can make and how to implement harder moves with care. After all, not every move will be enjoyed in every circumstance. If the PCs are delivering a powerful artifact to a wizard to be destroyed, having a minor adversary steal the artifact can spark an exciting story arc—or it can throw icy water on the party's excitement and make them feel all their work to retrieve it was pointless. As always, communication and collaboration are key, and hard actions shouldn't negate player agency or feel punishing.",

  "context": "## **避免削弱成功**\n\n在恐惧结果的成功时，GM可能遇到的一个陷阱是，在以GM行动作为后果时，削弱玩家的成功。例如，如果一名玩家角色进行一次灵巧掷骰，试图悄悄穿过走廊，他们成功了但骰出了恐惧结果，不要使用你的行动来拉响警报或让某人撞到他们，从而暴露他们的行踪。玩家角色掷骰成功了，这个成功应该得到尊重，即使伴随着后果。相反，考虑引入一个新的障碍物到他们的目标地点，或者增加一个从后面接近的新敌人来使他们的情况复杂化等选项。\n\n同样，如果玩家角色做了很酷的事情——比如巧妙地施放了一个法术——让他们享受这个过程，而不是立即破坏他们的计划，让场景进行一段时间，使用行动来改变和升级场景，而不是结束效果。例如，一名玩家角色可能绕过了你设置的陷阱；与其立即使用GM行动使陷阱生效，不如让玩家角色感到聪明，而你则使用你的下一个GM行动来召唤更多敌人，或者预示前方道路上可能存在的其他危险。当涉及高潮时刻或强大的敌人时——当你需要表明情况危急时，使用你的GM行动立即中止一个效果。\n\n在进行GM行动时，请牢记这一原则。以下章节提供了关于你可以做出哪些类型的行动以及如何谨慎地实施更强硬行动的建议。毕竟，并非所有行动在所有情况下都会受到欢迎。如果玩家角色正在将一件强大的神器送给一位法师销毁，让一个次要敌人偷走神器可能会引发一段激动人心的故事线——或者可能会给队伍的热情泼一盆冷水，让他们觉得之前为取回神器所做的一切努力都毫无意义。一如既往，沟通与协作是关键，强硬的行动不应否定玩家的主动性或让人感到惩罚。"

  "original": "## Examples of Improvised Fear Moves\n\n*Example 1: The party has confronted a corrupt noble who the GM, Stella, planned to use as a recurring villain, but most of the noble's HP are already marked and the party is close to dispatching them before their plans can be revealed. Deciding that they don't want to change plans and let the PCs claim this unexpected victory, Stella improvises a Fear move to allow the noble to escape using a method that makes sense for the adversary but hasn't been set up in the fiction yet. The noble, not previously shown to use magic, produces a token that allows them to teleport away. The GM has spent a Fear on an improvised \"Take away an opportunity\" move, and the villain survives to fight another day.*\n\n*Example 2: In a battle with the party, a Solo adversary's damage output isn't proving as much of a threat as Stella would have liked. She might decide to spend Fear and improvise an adversary feature where the enemy flies into a rage, increasing their damage for the remainder of the scene. Stella leads with the fiction, describing the enemy's increasing desperation due to their significant wounds, then signals the mechanical escalation to the PCs—the enemy's damage output will be much higher from here on out.*\n\n*Example 3: During a scene where Quinn's druid is tracking a kidnapper, Shepherd rolls a success with Fear. Stella invites Quinn to describe how their action allows the PCs to gain ground, then spends a Fear and describes a huge shadow passing over the group as they spot the kidnapper on the horizon—a Wyvern is on the hunt for flesh. Stella hadn't mentioned anything about Wyverns being active in this area, so she decides it's appropriate to spend a Fear rather than introduce the new threat with a normal GM move in response to the player's roll.*\n\n*Example 4: The party is facing off with a group of bandits trying to steal a treasure chest the group is transporting. Tabby, the warrior, just succeeded on an attack roll with Fear against one of their adversaries. Because Tabby rolled with Fear, play passes to the GM after Tabby deals damage.* \n\n*Stella has 10 Fear in her pool and decides to spend three to start the battle off strong. On the battlefield, there are two ribbet Bandits and a group of five Bandit Minions.*\n\n*Stella uses her move to spotlight the first Bandit, describing her leaping down from a tree to slide beneath the party's wagon and break some of the wooden floorboards to get to the treasure inside.* \n\n*Stella then spends a Fear to spotlight the second Bandit, a large, bullfrog-like figure with heavy armor. They leap down to put themselves between a few members of the party and swing a massive hammer, using their \"Better Surrounded\" action to hit all targets in range of their weapon. Stella rolls against the PCs' Evasion and succeeds. They then roll the adversary's damage dice and deal 12 physical damage to each target.* \n\n*Finally, Stella spends 2 Fear, the first to shift the spotlight to one of the Bandit Minions, and the second to use their \"Group Attack\" action (which costs a Fear to activate). This puts the spotlight on all five Minions, who move into Melee range of Tabby. Stella makes an attack, describing the scene and rolling against Tabby's Evasion. Stella succeeds, so the bandits deals 3 damage each for a total of 15 damage to Tabby. Tabby has no Armor Slots left, so she takes Major damage—marking 2 Hit Points.* \n\n*Stella has 7 Fear left but no more adversaries to spotlight, so Stella returns play to the PCs.* \n\n![](_page_156_Picture_18.jpeg)\n\n![](_page_156_Picture_19.jpeg)\n\n<span id=\"page-157-0\"></span>![](_page_157_Picture_0.jpeg)",

To make a Difficulty Roll, roll a d20 and add any relevant Experience the NPC or adversary has to its total.\n\n*Tip: Attack rolls against adversaries use that stat block's assigned Difficulty.

For example, when a Kraken attacks the party's boat to throw them into the sea, you might have the PCs all make a Strength or Agility Reaction Roll to see if they're able to keep themselves from falling overboard. For dramatic or difficult tasks that the PCs can't influence, you might want to roll to see if the adversary succeeds.

  "original": "## **CHASE COUNTDOWNS**\n\nYou can use dynamic countdowns to track the progress of a **chase** scene, whether the PCs are pursuing an NPC or being pursued themselves. When the chase begins, set two countdowns: one for the pursuing party and one for the escaping party. First pick a die for the pursuers' countdown the more time you want the chase to take, the higher the starting value should be—then set that die at its highest value. Next, select another die with the same starting value for the escapee's countdown, but set that die at a lower value to reflect how much of a lead they have (1 lower for a small lead, 3 lower for a decent lead, 5 lower for a substantial lead).\n\nFor example, a chase through a town market could use d6 dice and each tick of the countdown could represent one range band (Very Close to Close, Close to Far, Far to Very Far, etc.). For a chase playing out over a longer distance, such as the PCs pursuing bandits across the countryside, each tick on the countdown might represent several miles.\n\nRegardless of whether the PCs are pursuing or escaping, their action rolls advance both countdowns, as shown on the earlier Dynamic Countdown Advancement table. When a PC succeeds on an action roll, it ticks down their countdown, which is a progress countdown. When they fail on an action roll—or roll a success with Fear—it ticks down the other party's countdown, which is a consequence countdown. When setting the Difficulty of these rolls, consider the adversary's Difficulty plus any other narrative considerations.\n\n*Example: A thief has stolen Rune's wizard spellbook and now the PCs are chasing them across a market square. The GM, Stella, decides on a d6 for the pursuing PCs' progress countdown, then sets up the thief's countdown—a consequence countdown—by taking another d6 and setting its starting value to 3, since the thief has a slight head start.*\n\n*The warrior, Tabby, asks to go first, clambering up onto the market stall tents to run over the top rather than pushing through the crowds. Stella calls for an Agility Roll against the thief's Difficulty of 15, and Aliyah uses Tabby's Second-Story Traveler Experience to get a bonus. Quinn spends a Hope to Help an Ally, describing how Shepherd channels their affinity with air to boost Tabby up. With the help of Shepherd's d6 advantage die, Tabby rolls a success with Hope, so Stella ticks the PC's progress countdown from 6 to 4; this represents Tabby gaining on the thief and helping the group catch up by calling out a quicker route through the crowd.*\n\n*Next, Rune wants to take things into his own hands. Using his Book of Sitil grimoire, he describes how he conjures an illusion of a runaway horse charging across the thief's path, forcing them to slow down rather than get trampled. Rune makes a Spellcast Roll against Difficulty 15, but rolls a failure with Fear. Stella describes the thief seeing through the illusion at the last moment and ducks through a busy crowd that blocks the party's path. Stella ticks the thief's consequence countdown down from 3 to 1 as the thief makes it to Far range away from the party. The thief is eluding their sight and in real danger of getting away—if the consequence countdown ticks down one more time, the thief will be gone.*",

If you were writing an epic fantasy book series, you might accomplish this by worldbuilding and developing characters, researching the genre, making a mood board, and outlining the book.\n\nMany tabletop roleplaying games do this via a **session zero**. This term means different things to different people, but for Daggerheart, it's how you set up your group to tell a successful fantasy epic together. Before making characters or deciding on the setting, the group talks about what everyone wants from this experience.\n\nThe GM facilitates session zero, but all players should be active participants, advocating for what they do and don't want from the campaign.\n\nThere are many tools for structuring your session zero. If everyone in your group has played together before, you may already have a method for conducting this process. If you haven't done a session zero before or want to explore another process, the following sections offer suggestions.\n\nAn essential part of session zero is choosing your game's content and **safety tools**. These tools ensure players know they can avoid material that would be hurtful or upsetting and beyond that, safety tools empower players to explore challenging subjects everyone has signed up to engage with (to be what we'd call \"comfortably uncomfortable\"). In addition, these tools help the GM and players communicate during play. In improvisation, there is always the chance that something unexpectedly troubling comes up, or the participants need help remembering what story elements the group is avoiding or keeping \"off-screen.\" Safety tools give structure to pregame conversations and tools for working through mid-game hurdles.\n\nWe recommend the following tools:",

For instance, if your group includes LGBTQ players, prioritize their preferences on whether to include or exclude homophobia, transphobia, and other forms of oppression against queer people.\n\nThis is a good time to pick any specific safety tools you want to use during the campaign.

  "original": "## ASKING QUESTIONS\n\nDuring the session zero discussions, some GMs will find it useful to ask clarifying questions and dig deeper into suggestions and ideas. Regardless of whether you want to use an existing setting or build your own, one of the best ways to ensure that players are invested and excited to play is to encourage them to bring their ideas and interests to the planning stages in session zero.\n\nFor example, you might ask questions like the following during your session zero conversation:\n\n- \"Can you talk more about what you mean by wanting to make a post-fantasy world?\"\n- \"When you said it'd be cool if elven clans worked like a beehive, did you mean physiology, or is this more about communication and hierarchy?\"\n- \"What aspect of that fantasy series you mentioned are you most excited to bring into the game? The plot, the setting, the vibes, or something else?\"\n\nFostering an atmosphere of curiosity is also useful for interrogating your own assumptions in worldbuilding. Rather than treating typical fantasy conventions as the default, you can make conscious decisions about your world to intentionally build a setting that best fits the fiction your table wants to create. For example, your group might consider questions like:\n\n- \"Should all the major countries in our region be monarchies, or do we want them to have different forms of government? If they're monarchies, are they feudal, bureaucratic, or a different structure entirely?\"\n- \"How do people think about gender in this world? Do conceptions of gender vary by community, by region, or something else?\"\n- \"What, if anything, do we want to change in the existing setting we're using to better fit the story we're telling?\"\n\nEvery group is different and every GM's style is their own, so use the parts of collaborative worldbuilding that excite you, and feel free to leave behind the aspects that don't.",

This could lead to the mercenaries fortifying the mayor's house with him as a hostage while the members of the town guard ask the PCs for assistance.\n\nThinking in beats is also useful for larger-scale planning and off-screen thinking. If the party is racing toward a city to prevent a coup, you can use a progress countdown to track their distance from the city and a standard countdown to represent the steps of that coup. Keep the pace of both countdowns in mind when setting the frequency of events. If the PCs need to travel five hundred miles (represented by the progress countdown), then the coup could take place over a week (represented by the standard countdown), with a countdown step occurring each day. As the PCs make action rolls to determine how far they can travel in a day, you can resolve the advancement of the Progress Countdown, then tick down the standard countdown by 1. Should the PCs need to travel a shorter distance, you can similarly shrink the time frame the coup takes place over, such as from a week to a few days, with each countdown step occurring every few hours. This format lets you know what's happening as the PCs burst onto the scene, rather than having to improvise in the moment.",

Through this lens, we can start to think about enemies and damage as more than collections of mechanics and stat blocks—they're tools in our GM toolbox for heightening tension and creating drama.\n\nAs you start GMing Daggerheart, balancing encounters and creating appropriate enemies for your players will often take guesswork during prep. However, the more sessions you run, the easier it will become. Adjust on the fly as necessary to find the right balance as you play, and you'll naturally figure out what works best for your table. The most important element is to ensure that combat is being used to give players more information about the unfolding story—it reveals more about the world, the plot, or the characters.\n\nThis section includes general advice for prepping encounters that will, hopefully, make your life easier. These tips are meant to help with creating narratively-grounded encounters and planning how to best challenge your party based on their current capabilities and circumstances.

Whenever you start a session, arrive at a new place, or change the situation, the players are going to look to you for what they need to know. When you do this, think with all of your senses—not just what this place looks like, but what does it smell, feel, taste, and sound like? What is something unique or unexpected about this place, and what does that say about it? Your players will use these details to interact with the world, so give them enough to not only picture the scene, but make choices about what they do and where they go.\n\n*Example: \"You step into the mouth of the cave and for a long moment you're in pitch darkness. You can hear the soft tap, tap, tap of water in the distance suggesting there may be an underground river ahead. The stone is slick beneath your feet, as you gingerly step forward. At first, there's only the dank smell you expect from a cave: the earthy tang of lichen on mold. But then there's a gust of wind forced from deep within the cavern, and you're overcome by the sickly sweet smell of rotting meat. Something died here recently…*\n\n*As you move deeper inside, you begin to make out sharp white stalactites bearing down on you…. No—these aren't formations of stone. They're teeth! You aren't standing on slick stone; you're balanced on the salivating tongue of a great beast. You feel that fetid wash of air come over you again—the creature is taking a deep breath and preparing to swallow. What do you want to do?\"*",

Meanwhile, her internal conflicts might include struggling with the ideologies taught to her in school, or even fearing the destructive power of her own magic.\n\nThe strongest character arcs in Daggerheart emerge from a combination of internal and external conflicts. External conflicts can bring up unresolved tensions from internal conflicts, while resolving internal conflicts can provide clarity for a character that allows them to overcome external conflict.\n\nWhen designing conflicts for maximum emotional impact, challenge characters in a way that ties in their internal struggles. If a character struggles with self-confidence, challenge them to excel.

Some abilities (such as class or domain abilities) also force adversaries to mark Stress—these are highly useful in social conflicts so long as they're narratively applicable.

He describes the magical power needed to maintain a necromantic effect when a corpse is rendered into such small pieces.

  "original": "## Layering Goals into Combat\n\nThe drama of a battle should stem from narrative goals, rather than solely from the risk the PCs will die. Daggerheart isn't a particularly deadly game, and the players likely know that. The PCs typically fight for a reason, such as defending loved ones or subverting a villain's schemes—if their battle relates to multiple goals or narrative threads, this adds uncertainty to the outcomes and increases dramatic tension.\n\nYou can do this by ensuring that the adversary's motivation is front and center and introducing an objective that goes beyond \"kill or knock out the opponents.\" If you establish a special objective for the adversaries (or PCs) before the conflict begins, the scene suddenly has more dimensions and characters have immediate options for actions to take beyond just trading attacks. Another way of thinking about action scenes is to consider the defining action verb. Is this scene just about fighting the enemy or is the party securing a position so that the wizard can conduct the ritual by the solstice? The follow example illustrates a combat with three objectives:\n\n*Example: After the blood mage Caressa kidnapped the governor's husband Osten, the PCs tracked her across the Shattered Mountains. When they confront her in the Ruins of Nix, she's conducting a ritual to seize Osten's latent magical power. The PCs want to stop the ritual, save Osten, and capture Caressa. But which of those goals is most important? If the PCs are winning the fight, what happens if you put Osten in danger and make the players choose between rescuing him and capturing Caressa?*\n\nThe outcome of the previous example is uncertain, entirely dependent on the PCs' choices and luck. They could achieve a partial victory by capturing Caressa after Osten dies or allowing Caressa to get away to save Osten. With cleverness and good rolls, they could stop Caressa, capture her, and save Osten, accomplishing all their goals. The uncertainty is what makes the combat dynamic and tense.\n\nWhen in doubt, you can use the following table to randomly generate an objective to work into a combat or action scene. Roll 1d12 or pick an option to use as the goal of the adversaries (or the PCs).",

  "original": "#### **Change the Foes**\n\nVideo games often change their bosses at a certain point in a fight, such as when their health is halved or they're seemingly defeated. Taking a cue from those battles, you can change an adversary in behavior, form, or both: A massive, lumbering enemy splits into multiple, more agile adversaries who act in perfect synchronicity. A defeated foe courses with eldritch power that remolds their flesh into an unspeakable form and grants them sinister new powers.\n\nIn Daggerheart, you can create a phase change for an enemy in a few ways. You might give the foe a passive feature that triggers when half of their Hit Points are marked, or you might prepare two adversary stat blocks, one for each phase. This book presents several adversaries with the \"Phase Change\" feature, which you can use as inspiration for creating your own.\n\nIf you didn't prepare a phase change but the party is defeating a major foe more easily than expected, it's okay to let the PCs have the easy win. However, if that feels anticlimactic, feel free to improvise a phase two. Describe how the adversary seems to be defeated, then narrate them standing back up or surging with new energy, clear some of their HP, change some of their statistics or base attack, and improvise a new feature or two to represent how they've changed. An enemy that throws off their armor might lower their damage thresholds but gain Relentless and move about with blistering speed. You might even switch to a different stat block on the fly as the foe transforms into a new and unexpected form.\n\nWhen an enemy takes a new form, try to draw upon the story to explain the second phase. A blood mage holding out a bloody hand and channeling a powerful spell to transform into an Abomination is both surprising and inevitable. But if the players never learned that the enemy was a blood mage, that reveal won't be as satisfying. Foreshadow information about enemies in advance as much as you can, but if you have to create connective tissue in the moment, you can treat it as a reveal as the transforming enemy boasts about not having demonstrated their full power.",

  "original": "## **CHOOSING A DEATH MOVE**\n\nWhen a PC marks their last Hit Point, they must make a death move. Two of the three moves give the player full control over whether their PC lives or dies: with Blaze of Glory, the player is accepting the PC's death, and with Avoid Death, the player is defying the PC's death. Risk It All comes down to a dice roll the PC has a nearly even chance of living or dying.\n\nWhen a player is considering which death move to choose, make space for them to work and talk through their decision. You might give them a moment to think by shifting focus to another PC, or keep focus on the dying PC to let the player take the reins of the story.\n\nCharacter death is not always satisfying in the moment, especially if the character's cause of death isn't directly tied to their personal story. But in a heroic fantasy adventure, death is always a possibility for characters trying to change the world. Death moves give a fatally injured PC a chance for a memorable moment, whether it's going out in a Blaze of Glory or Risking It All on a roll of the dice.",

  "original": "## Avoid Death\n\nIf a player is certain they aren't ready to say goodbye to their PC, this death move ensures the PC's survival—though they have a chance of taking a scar and permanently crossing out one of their Hope slots. If the character only has one Hope slot remaining when they make this move and they gain a scar, the player must retire the character. Even so, that ending may be preferable for players who would rather see their character give up the adventuring life than die.\n\nUsing this move, the PC stays unconscious until healed by an ally or until the party's next long rest. Try to give the player chances to participate in play if the party isn't able to heal their PC or finish a long rest in short order. You might invite them to temporarily control an NPC in the meantime or, for something more character focused, narrate a scene of their PC on the knife's edge between life and death. On this precipice, they could be visited by the spirit of a departed loved one, receive a vision of a disaster they need to avert, or encounter something else that keeps them involved in the story.\n\nEven without gaining a scar, this move still comes with a cost: the current situation worsens, no matter the PC's fate. Work with the player to determine how that manifests. The situation might escalate as a new wave of enemies approaches or a countdown ticks down. Alternatively, the PC's fall might be what turns the tide of battle in the enemy's favor—they might seize an important item from the heroes or draw power from the character's suffering.",

The Duality Dice decide the character's fate, and with the exception of the 10th-level Resurrection spell (which can only be used once), that roll is final unless you provide another means of resurrection in your story. If the player rolls with Hope, help them decide how to divide the value of the Hope Die between Hit Points and Stress to clear. You might remind the player that if they choose to clear only a small number of Hit Points, they may be forced to make another death move after just one further blow.\n\nThough it is important to reward your player if they roll with Hope by spotlighting this moment when their PC defies death, it is just as important to reward your player if they roll with Fear and their character meets their end. Let them have some final words with a friend or a memory that plays as they fade from consciousness.

When multiple PCs are making death moves and there's a real risk that everyone will die, it's important to check in with the players as the scene unfolds. How do they feel about the scene and the chance that the whole party will be left dead or incapacitated? Is this a good place for the campaign's story to potentially end? Should the PCs cut their losses and flee? Since PCs that choose Avoid Death are helpless without assistance, the party is left at the mercy of their adversaries or fate (the GM) if every PC takes that option.\n\nIt's also useful to consider the motivation of the adversaries present. Do the adversaries want to kill the PCs, or do they just want the party out of the way so they can pursue their motives? Would they be more likely to leave the PCs for dead, take them prisoner to gloat, or capture them to extract information?\n\nIf your players aren't interested in a heroic tragedy at the moment, work with them to decide what makes sense in the scene. Death is a real threat in Daggerheart, but the game is always a collaboration. If the party is going to meet their end, it should be because everyone at the table wants to tell that story. If the players don't want the party to die here but it's difficult to come up with a way they survive, look to their background questions and their relationships with factions and prominent NPCs. Are they taken captive by the enemy? Does an old ally show up with reinforcements to drive off the enemies? Does an agent of the seraph's god or a nature spirit friendly to the druid whisk the PCs away to safety? Does an associate of the Syndicate rogue provide cover for the PCs to withdraw?\n\nIf the group decides that their party's story is done but they want to continue the overall campaign, hold a mid-campaign session zero to make new characters and figure out how to connect this new party to the existing story in a way that everyone is excited about.

This accelerates the power growth of your PCs, but it also allows them to experience the full arc of their characters' mechanics before the campaign ends.\n\nWhen your PCs level up, they'll gain new abilities, spells, damage thresholds, Experiences, and more, so be sure to review what changed for them. This is a good time to plan opportunities for your players to use those new features over the next arc. For example, if a PC's new ability helps them eavesdrop on conversations, you could begin the next session with an espionage mission where that skill comes in handy.

If you're utilizing a campaign frame, use the map detailed in that section. Digital copies of these maps are available on the Daggerheart website for download.\n\nIf you know at character creation that you'll be running a campaign, you can bring a blank map to your session zero to fill out together. Otherwise, you can always introduce it at the top of your next session to integrate into your game moving forward.\n\nTo start, place the map on the table and explain to the players that you'll be using it to build the region together. Choose the name of the region from the options available (or make up your own) and write that name on the sheet. If you're using a campaign frame, the name of the region is provided for you.\n\nNext, remind the players about any locations they have already created for the setting. Pass the map around and have them label the locations they created anywhere they'd like.\n\nThen, choose one of the locations from the list on the sheet and add it to the map. Describe this place for the rest of the table—what is it? Why is it called this? What makes it so significant? Then pass the map to another player to do the same. Encourage them to tie in their character's backstory or history with the new location if they wish. As players describe the locations they've chosen, record any important information about them in your notes.\n\nThe map should continue around the table like this until it feels like it is populated with enough exciting locations and plot hooks for you to work with. With four players, twice around the table is usually enough. Remember, you can always do this again at the start of another session to fill out the map further, or even introduce a new region that connects to the current one.\n\nAfter the table feels happy with the details they've added, take the map back and begin the adventure. Maybe it's somewhere the players have already added, or maybe it's a new place either way, this will help you orient yourself for the campaign moving forward.",

Pay attention to where the PCs currently are in their journey where might they consider going next?\n\nIt's also important to leave blanks. Don't feel the need to fill everything in, and don't worry about planning out what every labeled landmark or town is like.

  "original": "## **TYING BACKSTORIES TOGETHER**\n\nOnce you've identified key points in each PC's story, identify which of these pieces of information could be related—how these stories could potentially cross paths—and draw some connections between them.\n\nMaybe Maverick, the snobby human treasure collector that Barnabas is rivals with, could be the same person that Astrid Galamore, the halfling princess, was forced to marry? And if that's the case, what if Maverick was now forcing Mage Yaro to use his magic to invade the fungril network and seize more great treasures around the world without having to leave the kingdom? This would create a crossover between Jasper, Sprout, and Barnabas, so it seems like a good place to start our campaign. But let's keep thinking.\n\nThis type of conflict would likely eventually lead them to return to the Galamore kingdom to stop Maverick. This journey could be hindered by the fungril forces Mage Yaro is controlling, giving Sprout an opportunity to interact with the corrupted network and get hints of what is to come in a way nobody else would be able to. And when they all finally arrive in the Galamore kingdom, there could be a twist! Maybe Astrid convinced Quill, her and Jasper's bard friend, to use shapeshifting magic to take her place right under Maverick's nose so she could leave the kingdom and search for Jasper? This could be a fun opportunity to flip the \"princess in peril\" trope on its head and provide an unexpected reveal once they reach the kingdom. If this is the case, we'll also want to brainstorm a clue Astrid could leave behind at the secret place where she and Jasper used to meet so the party can go after her. But that's down the road, no need to flesh that out immediately.\n\nMarigold needs some love—maybe we could put the floating city of Bloomfare in the great dragon Krugthar's path of destruction? This would push Marigold to return home and face the consequences of her actions to save her mother's life, while giving Barnabas an opportunity to chase down the dragon he wants so badly. But given they'll have to face a dragon, this should probably be later in the campaign. So perhaps in the interim, to keep Marigold's backstory involved, we could put some elemental creatures on the party's trail intermittently as they travel. This will keep the threat of her home and the reminder of what she did relevant until she must return to confront them. Maybe we even make that our first encounter of the campaign to set up that long-running danger and tie Marigold in at the start.\n\nA few extra threads to tie up—Sprout should probably have to deal with what she did in Branishar. Either she faces signs of the same thing happening wherever she travels, or something pushes her to return home. Barnabas should probably discover something unexpected about Nira's death—could she still be alive? If so, maybe she finds him to reveal that her father King Guthril secretly set up an ambush to have her killed. It wasn't Barnabas's fault, and Nira wants revenge.\n\nThat's more than enough for now! As the campaign plays out, there will be plenty more to work with and some of these plans may change drastically—but this is a great foundation to work from.",

  "original": "## <span id=\"page-189-0\"></span>PLANNING A STORY ARC\n\nNow that we have some ideas of what could potentially happen in our campaign, it's time to talk about **story arcs**. Arcs are a connected series of sessions within a campaign that focus on a specific objective, theme, character, or idea. Though you won't know for sure the path your players will take, by preparing the structure of the arc, you can ensure that you're giving them the adequate narrative fodder for a satisfying story.\n\nArcs are typically between three to five sessions in length, though they can be longer depending on how large of a campaign you're running. It's usually good to start small and build up to larger arcs as players get more invested in the story you're telling together, but an arc's structure typically remains the same regardless of the length.\n\nThere are a few different structures that stories often take, but we're going to use the Three-Act Structure as our framework because it is the most common and is the easiest to identify in many of today's movies and TV shows. As always, feel free to experiment with your own style of storytelling and only use the things from this section that help you at your table!\n\nThe Three-Act Structure is pretty straightforward—Act One is the introduction, Act Two is the trials and tribulations, and Act Three is the finale.\n\nThis is something we see in almost every popular movie or TV show—a character wants something, they work hard and face challenges to get that thing, and finally succeed or fail. Either way, they always change because of the journey they went through. Because of this, it's often what players expect out of a good story, even if they don't know it. It's what feels satisfying to us, because it's the way we're used to seeing stories. We can utilize that expectation in our prep to make our work easier.\n\nLet's take the example from the previous \"Tying Backstories Together\" section to form our first arc. Given how much the NPC Maverick is intertwined in multiple PCs' backstories, he's going to be our focus here, since that will give almost everyone a chance to have their backstories interwoven into the story at the start. Maverick is the snobby human treasure collector who is Barnabas's rival, and we've made the decision that Maverick is the one who stole Astrid Galamore's hand in marriage, even though she has been in love with our party's bard Jasper since childhood. Because Maverick is now residing in the kingdom with her, we've also decided that he is forcing Jasper's old mentor, Mage Yaro, to use his arcane powers to tap into the expansive fungril network and hunt for treasure remotely, disrupting Sprout's connection to the fungril network. And on their way to the kingdom, there will be no waiting around for the perfect opportune moment to act, because Marigold has a set of powerful elemental leaders hot on her trail.",

  "original": "## **ACT ONE:** COLLISION\n\nLet's make an event collide with our party that they can't ignore. It's often best to go to the most obvious answers first, then complicate things from there. In this case, let's set up Maverick going after an artifact that the party has been asked to protect. If he's using the fungril network to do it, then perhaps Maverick has Yaro create plantlike creatures filled with the fungus that he can control! There's our first act encounter—and we can build the rest of this act from there.\n\nThe most important thing to keep in mind about Act One is that you want to use it to introduce a bigger conflict the party will encounter later—give them a taste of what's to come and draw them into the arc's story. Using the techniques in the earlier \"Running a Session\" section, after you've played through Act One with your table, you might end up with something like this:\n\n**Beat One:** On their way to the city of Helayre, the party runs across the damage left behind by elementals—Marigold recognizes the work of those chasing her.\n\n**Beat Two:** As the party arrives in Helayre, they notice that large plants have overwhelmed everything. They also meet kind townsfolk who tell them about the attacks on the city by plant creatures at night. Upon inquiry, they'll be taken to where the attacks are the worst—the university.\n\n**Beat Three:** At the university, the students all know Barnabas by name—the headmistress, Olivia Rose, is a proponent of his work. She shows the party what the plant creatures are after: the Stone Soul, belonging to a griffin from the hidden island of Boga Tiren. Olivia's parents disappeared searching for Boga Tiren when she was a kid, and she has spent her life looking for them. If they extract the memory of its location from one of the plant creatures, then maybe she can find the island.\n\n**Beat Four:** Olivia captured a plant creature that attacked. When Sprout uses Death Connection, she learns it's full of tiny mushrooms. She gets clearer flashes of the mage in a nearby port town. He cries out for help, looking pained. The mage is consumed by a memory in which a voice tells him to \"get to the stone.\"\n\n**Beat Five:** Plant creatures descend on the university. The party must hold them back and defend the Stone Soul. As the final creature goes down in battle, the party hears the mage's voice seep through it—the voice calls out to Jasper with a nickname familiar only to Yaro. With the planet creatures defeated and Yaro revealed, Act One is complete.\n\nThough the party's decisions might require you to adapt or make changes, this framework will help you use Act One to set up the rest of the arc. It creates questions for the PCs to chase—why is Yaro doing this? Why did he sound scared? Who was giving him orders? Could it be Maverick, looking for relics? And also—Where is Boga Tiren? Why is it hidden? Dramatic questions like these drive the PCs forward into Act Two.",

Before the end of Act One, you should confirm which direction they're going to go before you dive into planning—they'll almost certainly want to figure out what's happening with Mage Yaro, but what if they decide to instead escort Professor Rose to Boga Tiren? Or something else entirely? It's often best to lead from behind as you approach Act Two—let the players show you the questions they want to answer most, then fill in the gaps as they move toward finding those answers.\n\nOnce the party is off on this quest, Act Two is all about the complications that get in the way. As you prep for these next sessions, the complications should matter—they should be personal and speak to the themes and tone of the campaign.\n\nIf, for example, the party decides to head north to the Galamore kingdom to find out what's happening with Mage Yaro, we know they'll be on the road for a few days to get up there. It might be tempting to throw in a few random encounters with wild animals, some people asking for help with unrelated issues, or some rolls to see how well they're able to survive the distant travel, but Act Two is all about building up to a climactic finale. So what can we do instead to make it feel like a story, rather than just time passing before we get to the Galamore kingdom?\n\nWe know Barnabas is searching for the legendary dragon Krugthar, and we're likely going to have a future arc (when the players are higher level) centered around his attack on Bloomfare (Marigold's home). One option is to foreshadow that event and show the dragon's power. Maybe we put a village decimated by fire on their path, the village's mage dead and the ruins gouged with immense claw marks. Those alive talk about an attack by a massive flying beast that disappeared into the sun—something Barnabas will immediately recognize as Krugthar. But to give the players something to act on now, maybe the beast had small companions or minions that could be creating havoc in the village, dragging important NPCs into the forest, or shapeshifting to replace normal citizens. You can change this encounter depending on the kind of challenge your table enjoys.\n\nWe also know from Sprout's backstory that if she stays somewhere too long, she rots away everything around her perhaps we see the devastating effect that Maverick and Yaro had on the environment. Perhaps the party encounters twisted arcane creatures riddled with fungus and struggles to traverse a sickly land. These events serve as a reminder to Sprout of the place she decimated and the destruction she left behind. She could have the chance at a bit of redemption here, or at least knowledge of this kind of blight that helps keep her friends safe.\n\nAnother option might be to encounter an additional place where Maverick's fungril creatures successfully stole another artifact of power—but this relic is something that can be consumed to steal another person's arcane power. Perhaps we decide this was the plan along, for Maverick to use Yaro until he could absorb his magic himself. Even without knowing the full context, the PCs will likely rush to the Galamore kingdom as fast as they can, knowing this powerful object has fallen into the wrong hands.\n\nWhatever the journey may entail, once the PCs have reached the kingdom to confront Yaro and learn about Maverick, we enter the final act of our arc.",

  "context": "## **第二幕：复杂化**\n\n在第二幕中，PC们踏上旅程，去解答他们的大问题。在第一幕结束之前，你应该在深入规划之前确认他们将走向哪个方向——他们几乎肯定会想弄清楚法师亚罗发生了什么，但如果他们决定护送罗斯教授去博加·提伦呢？或者完全是别的事情？当你接近第二幕时，通常最好是“从后方引导”——让玩家告诉你他们最想回答的问题，然后随着他们寻找答案的过程中填补空白。\n\n一旦队伍踏上这段任务，第二幕就全是阻碍他们前进的复杂情况。当你为接下来的游戏阶段做准备时，这些复杂情况应该是有意义的——它们应该是私人的，并呼应战役的主题和基调。\n\n例如，如果队伍决定向北前往加拉莫尔王国，去找出法师亚罗发生了什么，我们知道他们需要几天时间才能到达那里。也许会想加入一些随机遭遇，比如野兽、一些寻求无关帮助的人，或者一些掷骰来检验他们在长途旅行中的生存能力，但第二幕是关于为高潮结局做铺垫。那么，我们能做些什么来让它感觉像一个故事，而不是在到达加拉莫尔王国之前仅仅是时间流逝呢？\n\n我们知道巴纳巴斯正在寻找传说中的巨龙克鲁格萨尔，而且我们很可能在未来的一个故事弧线（当玩家等级更高时）围绕它袭击布鲁姆费尔（万寿菊的家乡）展开。一个选择是预示那个事件并展示巨龙的力量。也许我们在他们前进的道路上放置一个被火焰摧毁的村庄，村庄的法师已经死亡，废墟上布满了巨大的爪痕。幸存者谈论一只巨大的飞行野兽袭击后消失在太阳里——巴纳巴斯会立即认出那是克鲁格萨尔。但为了给玩家一些现在可以采取行动的事情，也许这只野兽有一些小同伴或爪牙，它们可能正在村庄里制造混乱，把重要的NPC拖进森林，或者变形来取代普通市民。你可以根据你的队伍喜欢的挑战类型来改变这个遭遇。\n\n我们还从斯普劳特的背景故事中得知，如果她在某个地方停留太久，她会腐蚀周围的一切。也许我们能看到马弗里克和亚罗对环境造成的毁灭性影响。也许队伍会遇到充满真菌的扭曲奥术生物，并在病态的土地上艰难跋涉。这些事件提醒着斯普劳特，她曾摧毁的地方以及她留下的破坏。她可以在这里获得一些救赎的机会，或者至少获得关于这种枯萎病的知识，这有助于保护她的朋友。\n\n另一个选择可能是遇到另一个马弗里克的孢菌生物成功窃取了另一件强大古物的地方——但这件遗物可以被消耗来窃取另一个人的奥术力量。也许我们决定这从一开始就是计划，马弗里克利用亚罗直到他自己能够吸收他的魔法。即使不了解全部背景，PC们也可能会尽快赶往加拉莫尔王国，因为他们知道这个强大的物品已经落入了错误的人手中。\n\n无论旅程可能包含什么，一旦PC们到达王国去对抗亚罗并了解马弗里克，我们就进入了我们故事弧线的最后一幕。"

  "original": "## **ACT THREE:** CLIMAX\n\nAct Three will usually see our PCs resolve some of the big questions they have and face off against the powerful force they've been preparing for through Act One and Act Two. Identify which answers the players are most excited about discovering and provide at least some of those answers in this act. Oftentimes, these answers are what launch the next arc of your campaign—having an idea of what they are going into this act will help you prepare for what's to come.\n\nThough not absolutely mandatory, it's also always a good idea to plan some sort of reveal, surprise, or twist in this act something that isn't quite what it seems. These plot twists keep the players on their toes and make them excited to find out what will happen next. In the case of our current example, we have a few twists prepared—Yaro is being controlled by Maverick, who has squirmed his way into the kingdom by marrying Astrid Galamore, Jasper's childhood love.\n\nAs we prepare this act, we should identify the questions we are going to answer—things like \"Who is forcing Yaro to do this?\" and \"What happened to Astrid?\" It's important to think through what Maverick would do to keep himself safe and Yaro under his control. Perhaps he orders the king's guard to attack the party when they enter the city, putting Jasper in conflict with the very people they grew up with. Maybe the kingdom is locked down and the drawbridge raised, forcing the group to find another way in. Think about how you can create a last set of complications that ramps up the tension until the final confrontation is inevitable.\n\nThe arc will end with a showdown between Maverick and the party. Maybe he still has Yaro under his control and uses the mage as a weapon against them. Maybe he has absorbed Yaro's arcane power using the relic he stole and is now attacking the party with magic himself. Maybe he has turned coward and is attempting to flee with Astrid through a secret tunnel beneath the castle. Whatever the encounter is, it should be a big, exciting, and dangerous ending to the arc that ties up some of the loose ends and creates an opportunity for more adventure in the next arc.",

  "original": "## <span id=\"page-191-0\"></span>LONG-FORM PLAY\n\nJust as an arc is a collection of scenes and sessions, a campaign can be thought of as a collection of arcs. The shape of your campaign will depend on your campaign frame (whether you're using a formal frame or not)—a campaign focused on the PCs rising to prominence as gladiators in one city-state will have a different shape than a grand tour campaign where PCs travel the world collecting the artifacts needed to defeat a world-ending threat. Some campaigns may be more episodic, with individual and seemingly disconnected adventures that eventually culminate into a larger story, and others might be a more serial narrative of unfolding arcs.\n\nDepending on your campaign, each story arc might end in the party leveling up, or a story arc might span across an entire tier of play (levels 2 through 4, 5 through 7, etc.). There's no wrong way to plan as long as it serves your needs as a GM and the players are enjoying the game. A longer campaign (closer to eight to ten sessions per level) may have several story arcs per level or more complex story arcs, plots with red herrings or tough choices that force the PCs to decide between simultaneous threats. Then you can take the plots that the players did not focus on and progress them so that when the PCs do get around to addressing them, the situations have escalated.\n\nA few sessions into a campaign, once everyone has a solid sense of their characters and their motivations, you can explore options for longer-term planning and how to help the group execute on the table's creative intentions for the campaign. Look at the background answers and connections, especially ones that haven't yet been explored. Ask yourself how these elements could work with what's already happened in the story. If a central character relationship between PCs already changed, what external events or situations could enrich or complicate that relationship? What elements of character backstory could provide dramatic contrast to how a character has presented themselves so far? What elements of the setting would be impacted by what's already happened in the story? What threats have grown while the PCs were taking action elsewhere?",

  "context": "## <span id=\"page-191-0\"></span>长期游戏\n\n就像故事弧线是场景和游戏阶段的集合一样，战役可以被看作是故事弧线的集合。你的战役形态将取决于你的战役框架（无论你是否使用正式框架）——一个专注于PC们在一个城邦中作为角斗士声名鹊起的战役，其形态将与一个宏大的巡游战役不同，在后者的战役中PC们周游世界收集击败终结世界威胁所需的古物。有些战役可能更具情节性，由独立的、看似不相关的冒险组成，最终汇聚成一个更大的故事；而另一些战役可能是一个更具连续性的、不断展开的故事弧线叙事。\n\n根据你的战役，每个故事弧线可能在队伍升级时结束，或者一个故事弧线可能跨越整个游戏层级（2到4级，5到7级等）。只要它符合你作为GM的需求并且玩家享受游戏，就没有错误的规划方式。一个更长的战役（每级接近八到十个游戏阶段）可能每级有几个故事弧线，或者更复杂的故事弧线，包含误导信息或迫使PC们在同时出现的威胁之间做出艰难选择的情节。然后，你可以将玩家没有关注的情节进行推进，这样当PC们最终处理它们时，情况就会升级。\n\n在战役进行几个游戏阶段后，一旦每个人对他们的角色及其动机有了清晰的认识，你就可以探索长期规划的选项，以及如何帮助团队实现其对战役的创造性意图。查看背景答案和联系，尤其是那些尚未被探索的。问问自己这些元素如何与故事中已经发生的事情相结合。如果PC之间的一个核心角色关系已经发生了变化，哪些外部事件或情况可以丰富或复杂化这种关系？角色的哪些背景故事元素可以与角色目前为止的表现形成戏剧性的对比？设定中的哪些元素会受到故事中已经发生的事情的影响？当PC们在别处采取行动时，哪些威胁已经壮大？"

  "original": "## **CONSTRUCTING ARCS**\n\nImagine a rope. You have dozens of smaller cords twisted around one another to create something stronger and longer lasting than any one thread could be as an individual. That rope is a story arc, and the cords are the plots that weave together to craft it. While the rope always starts frayed, the cords tighten around one another as the story unfolds to create a cohesive and satisfying narrative.\n\nWe build story arcs by breaking them into three or four sessions that each cover a major plot beat. These beats are created when we intertwine several ongoing storylines, which we'll call A-, B-, and C-plots. As you chart out arcs, you'll determine which storylines to prioritize when they best deserve focus. By threading storylines into beats, then those beats into arcs, you can weave the arcs together into one thrilling, cohesive campaign.\n\n**A-PLOT:** The star of the show, often dealing with the primary action of a session. Early in a campaign, this typically involves taking the first steps into revealing a larger world and a looming threat. As a campaign moves forward, A-plots will fall away as B- and C-plots rise into their place.\n\n**B-PLOT:** This plot is flexible and often throws a wrench into the gears turning the A-plot, forcing the party to divert their attention. The B-plot in one arc should become the A-plot in the next.\n\n**C-PLOT:** The least-featured plot thread in an arc or beat, the C-Plot exists to seed upcoming and important plot threads. These are best used sparingly—you'll know you did it right when a late-campaign revelation has a trail of breadcrumbs, only visible in hindsight, leading back to some of the earliest story points. C-plots often become B-plots in subsequent arcs.\n\nYou can always inject a D/E/F-plot into the story if it calls for it. But even if you have more than three major plot threads in your story, focusing on three in any given session will help keep everything manageable.\n\nIn the table below, you'll see four example narratives: \"Marigold's Four Elementals,\" \"Sprout's Power,\" \"Krugthar's Destruction,\" and \"Yaro's Return,\" and how they might weave together into a three-arc campaign.\n\n| ARC                        | SESSION | 1      | 2      | 3      | 1      | 2      | 3      | 4      | 1      | 2      | 3      | 4      |\n|----------------------------|---------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Marigold's Four Elementals |         | A-Plot | A-Plot | A-Plot |        |        |        |        |        |        |        |        |\n| Sprout's Power             |         |        | B-Plot | B-Plot | A-Plot | A-Plot | A-Plot | A-Plot |        |        |        |        |\n| Krugthar's Destruction     |         |        |        |        |        | B-Plot | B-Plot | B-Plot | A-Plot | A-Plot | A-Plot | A-Plot |\n| Yaro's Return              |         |        |        | C-Plot |        | C-Plot |        | C-Plot |        | B-Plot | B-Plot | B-Plot |",
